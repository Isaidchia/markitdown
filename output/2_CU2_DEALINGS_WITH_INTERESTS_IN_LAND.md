## CU2: DEALINGS WITH INTERESTS IN LAND

To be able to advise clients on property matters and to deal with property transactions on behalf of buyers/sellers or landlords/tenants, real estate salespersons need to understand when a contract is entered and the consequences, if the obligations are not fulfilled. They should be mindful that they owe a fiduciary duty to their principals and the duty of care to others.

Real estate salespersons should also understand an important concept of lan d, whereby 'land' refers not so much to the physical land but an 'interest' or a 'bundle of rights' in land. One of the characteristics is the right of the owner to deal with the land. An interest is usually acquired through a sale and purchase, but it may also be vested in a person by way of gift, trust or succession. Other than alienation of the entire interest, an owner may carve out a lesser interest such as a lease, mortgage or an easement to co-exist with his proprietary interest. If the right to possession is vested only in the future, it is a future interest.

## DEFINITION OF CONTRACT

A contract is an agreement entered into voluntarily by two parties or more with the intention of creating a legal obligation, which may have elements in writing, though contracts can be made orally.

## Examples of Contracts:

- -Option to Purchase (HDB / Private sale)
- -Sales &amp; Purchase Agreement
- -Lease Agreement
- -Sole Agency Agreement
- -Commission Agreement etc

## ELEMENTS OF CONTRACT

For a contract to be valid and enforceable, the following essential elements must be present:

- -Intention to create legal relations
- -Offers
- -Accep tance
- -Consid e ration

## INTENTION TO CREATE LEGAL RELATIONS

- -Creation of legal relations is a doctrine that states an agreement is legally enforceable only if the contracting parties may be deemed by the court to have intended it.
- -Commercial Agreements:

Parties involved are presumed to create legal relations, unless the circumstances or nature of an agreement preclude this.

E.g., where a contract states expressly that it does not intend to create legal relations, then the courts will not seek to create any

- -Social and Domestic Agreements

Generally presumed not to intend legal consequences.

## OFFER

- -Promise, or other expression of willingness, by one person (offeror) to be bound on certain specified terms upon the unqualified acceptance of these terms by the other person (offeree).
- -Must be communicated and conveyed

## INVITATION TO TREAT

An invitation to treat is an indication that someone is prepared to receive offers with the view to forming a binding contract. It is not an offer in itself.

## 4 types of an invitation to treat

## 1. Auction sales

The rule is that the bidder is making an offer to buy and the auctioneer accepts this in whatever manner is customary, usually the fall of the hammer.

## 2. Advertisements

This is an attempt to induce offers and is therefore classified as an invitation to treat.

3. Exhibition of goods for sale

This is displaying goods in a shop such as Tesco etc. this constitutes inviting customers to make offers to purchases such items or invitation to treat.

4. An invitation for tenders

A tender is an estimate submitted in response to a prior request. When a person tenders for a contract he is making an offer to the person who has advertised a contract as being available.

## UNILATERAL CONTRACT VS. BILATERAL CONTRACT

A real estate sales contract is a "bilateral" (two-way) agreement. The seller agrees to sell, and the buyer agrees to buy. Compare this with an option; an option is a unilateral (one-way) agreement in that the seller is obligated to sell, but the buyer is not obligated to buy - it is his option to do so.

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## COUNTER-OFFERS

If the offeree tries to change the terms of the offer in the acceptance, then it is not an acceptance, it is a counter-offer.

A counter-offer rejects the offer.

The position of the two parties is reversed. The offeree becomes the offeror and the  offeror becomes the offeree.

## TERMINATION OF AN OFFER

Can be terminated under the following situations:

- -Withdrawal: can happen at any time prior to its acceptance, provided there is communication, of the withdrawal to the offeree, whether by the offeror or through some reliable source
- -Rejection of an offer: includes making of a counter-offer or a variation of the original terms.
- -Lapse: In the absence of an express stipulation as to time, an offer will lapse after a reasonable time.
- -Death of the offeror: If known to the offeree, would render the offer incapable of being accepted by the offeree. Even in the absence of such knowledge, death of either party terminates any offer which has a personal element

## ACCEPTANCE

Offer is accepted by unconditional acceptance to its terms by the offeree. Counter offer is not an acceptance.

Acceptance must be communicated to the offeror and cannot be inferred from mere silence.

Acceptance must be in the mode specified, eg options indicates that acceptance must be handed to solicitor by 4pm.

## CONSIDERATION

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

- Consideration is something of value

- Each party to the contract must receive something of value for the promise

- For real estate transactions, consideration is usually money.

- Few rules governing consideration:

- Consideration must move from the promisee ;

- Consideration must move to the promisor ;

- Past consideration is no consideration;

- The consideration given must be sufficient , but it need not be adequate.

## DOCUMENTATION

Real estate contracts must be in writing to be enforceable.

Under the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Chapter 61), conveyance of any estate or interest in land other than a lease for a period not exceeding 7 years must be done in deed in the English language.

## THE '3PS'

The 3Ps : parties, property, and price must be stated for a valid contract. For some cases, common law may require a 4 th P, 'Provisions'

This can be in the form of emails or any other written correspondence and need not be in a single document.

## OPTION TO PURCHASE

Option to Purchase  = Right to buy

When a property buyer has an Option (a right) , he has the right to demand for the seller's title, and to demand that the seller goes to legal completion.

If the option is assigned or transferred, (if assignment of Option is allowed), the same right is enjoyed.

In order for the right to arise, the buyer must do the following:

- i. Pay the seller the option money which is equivalent to 1% of the agreed sale price
- ii. Within the stipulated Option period (usually within 14 days of the Option) exercise the right by signing the 'acceptance copy' of the Option form, a nd pay the balance of 4%/9% of the sale price.

## IMPORTANT RULES OF OTP

- -A right granted to the buyer to buy It stops the seller from offering the same property to another prospective buyer up till the expiry date of the option. When the Option provides for 'and/or nominee(s)' the seller has to accept the contract with the eventual option holder.
- -Does not compel the buyer to buy If the buyer decides not to go ahead with the purchase, he is free to walk away from the deal, losing only the 1% option money.
- -Compels seller to sell

The OTP compels the seller to enter into a sale contract with the option holder, whoever the holder may be, unless there is a provision prohibiting the assignment of the Option. Once a binding contract is formed, neither party could retract from the contract without facing the legal consequences.

- -Seller has right to forfeit Option Money

In the event that the buyer decides not to go ahead with the purchase, the seller has the right to forfeit the Option money and therefore no party can take any further action.

## OPTION MONEY

- -Where a vendor gives an "option' to a prospective purchaser, he is making an offer to sell his property at a specified price.
- -In consideration of the 'option money' paid by the prospective purchaser, the vendor thereby agrees to keep the offer open for the purchaser's acceptance, until the expiry of the appointed day and time specified in the 'option'.
- -Without the payment of the 'option money', the vendor is free to revoke his offer, at any time before acceptance by the prospective purchaser.

## SUBJECT TO CONTRACT

A contract specifies "subject to contract ' may fall into one of three categories:

- -The parties are immediately bound to the bargain, but they intend to restate the deal in a formalised contract that will not have a different effect; e.g. Letter of Intent prior to the signing of Tenancy Agreement or
- -The parties have completely agreed to the terms, but have made the execution of some terms in the contract conditional on the creation of a formalised contract; e.g. subject to optioning the approval from LADU for foreigners purchasing restricted properties or
- -It is merely an agreement to agree, and the deal will not be concluded until the formalised contract has been drawn up, e.g. option to purchase will not translate to a sale and purchase until the exercise of the option

## LEGALITY OF CONTRACT

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

Any agreement to violate the law and any agreement forbidden by law is void.

E.g.. Foreigners are not allowed to buy landed properties in Singapore without permission.

## CAPACITY

The parties must have the capacity to enter into a legally binding contract.

Persons do not have such capacity include:

- Minors

Under the law, persons who are below 21 years of age cannot enter into a contract involving property transactions.

- Persons suffering from mental illness

Any contract made with a person who is suffering from mental illness at the time of contracting and who is incapable of understanding the nature of the contract would be void.

## TERMS OF CONTRACT

- -Term(s) are provision(s) forming part of a contract.
- -Each term gives rise to a contractual obligation

## CONDITIONS &amp; WARRANTIES

Conditions : terms which go to the very root of a contract

If one party breaches a condition then the other party may:

- -End the contract: Refuse to perform their part of the contract; or
- -Claim damages: Continue with the contract but then sue for damages.

Warranty : Warranty is not so imperative so the contract will subsist after a warranty breach.

If one party breaches a warranty then the other party can only continue with the contract and then sue for damage

## EXPRESS AND IMPLIES TERMS

- -Term may either be express or implied
- -Express term is stated by the parties during negotiation or written in a contractual document.
- -Implied terms are not stated but nevertheless form a provision of the contract.

## UNSATISFACTORY REPLIES

Buyer's lawyer writes to relevant government department to obtain satisfactory replies on legal requisitions. If no satisfactory reply, buyer can annul the OTP and take back all deposits.

## REPRESENTATIONS

Not everything that's said during the negotiations for a contract end up being actual terms of the contract; some information only amounts to a representation

To distinguish between a term and a representation:

- -Relative knowledge . Does one party have expert knowledge of the subject matter?
- -Reliance . Did one party obviously rely on what was said when they entered into the contract?
- -The strength of the statement.
- -Timing . Did the statement immediately precede the making of the contract?

## VITIATING FACTORS IN A CONTRACT

## Contracts can be:

- -Void: Stating that the contract does not exist
- -Voidable: Vitiating factor identified and acknowledged yet party can continue if to benefit, or avoid and set aside
- -Unenforceable: Contract that is valid, but court will not enforce. For eg, contract is unenforceable if it violates frauds.

## Vitiating Factors:

- -Mistake
- -Misrepresentation
- -Duress
- -Undue influence

## MISTAKE

## 3 different types of mistake in contract

- Unilateral mistake: Only one party has made a mistake

- Mutual mistake: Both parties have made a different mistake

- Common mistake: Both parties have made the same mistake

## Mistakes relating to signed documents non est factum

- -If one of the parties signs a document under the complete misapprehension as to its affects a plea of non est factum (it is not my deed) may be raised. However, this is rarely successful. It applies only where the document signed is fundamentally different to what was believed to be signed and only where the party was not careless in signing.

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## MISREPRESENTATION

A misrepresentation is a false statement of fact , made by one party to another, which induces the other party to enter into a contract .

In the course of negotiations leading up to the formation of a contract, many statements of fact may be made. Some of them may be incorporated into the final contract and they become the terms of the contract. Other statements of fact may not be so incorporated. Yet, if they are material and turn out to be untrue and there is a misrepresentation, the aggrieved partly may rescind the contract .

A representation may be express, or it may be inferred from the representor's conduct. On its own, silence or non-disclosure does not usually constitute a representation.   There are, however, exceptions to this general rule. If a party makes a positive but incomplete disclosure, the omitted disclosure may amount to a misrepresentation if it has the effect of distorting the truth of the information disclosed. Similarly, a failure to correct an earlier (and continuing) representation that was true at the time it was made but which has subsequently become incorrect is actionable. A failure to disclose material facts whilst negotiating contracts uberrimae fidei, such as insurance contracts, would also give rise to an action for misrepresentation.

In order for an action for misrepresentation to succeed, the following must be shown:

- -Statement of fact , not opinion.
- -False statement .
- -Statement must be material (sufficiently important) enough to make a difference in the decision of the innocent party to enter into the contract. If it can be shown that the innocent party would have entered into the contract regardless of whether the statement is true or false, then an action for misrepresentation will not succeed.
- -Statement of fact must be addressed to the innocent party .

## TYPES OF MISREPRESENTATION

## Fraudulent misrepresentation

Fraudulent misrepresentation is a statement made with an intent to deceive and with the knowledge that it is false .

## Negligent misrepresentation

Negligent misrepresentation is a statement made in the belief that it is true but without reasonable grounds for the belief, because it was made without due care for its accuracy. Therefore, where due care was taken, e.g. proper checks were performed, but the statement was nonetheless incorrect, the courts have refused to impose liability for negligent misrepresentation.

Negligent misrepresentation arises not from the agent's intent to mislead or deceive the purchaser, but rather from his lack of care in ascertaining or confirming the accuracy of the information he provides to the purchaser.  It can also be the result of the agent's failure to check the information he receives from the vendor.

The most common complaint brought by potential purchasers against estate agents, is their misrepresentation of information relating to a property.

## Innocent misrepresentation

Innocent misrepresentation is a statement made in the belief that it is true and with reasonable grounds for that belief.

## CAVEAT EMPTOR

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

Principle of caveat emptor (let the buyer beware) applies i.e. the prospective buyer is required to examine and satisfy himself of the property he is buying . He will bear his own risk in buying the property subject to the seller not misleading him by making false statements or misrepresentations.

## UNDUE INFLUENCE

- A contract is said to have been entered into as a result of undue influence where one is in a position to determine the will of the other party and uses the position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other.

- He is prevented from exercising an independent judgment because of the unfair pressure exerted on him

## ELEMENTS OF UNDUE INFLUENCE

- One person is in a position to dominate the will of the other.

- The party domination the will uses the position to dominate the will of the other.

## DURESS

- Duress occurs when the buyer is given no choice to make his decision

Duress in contract law falls into two broad categories:

- i. Physical duress: threat of physical violence

- ii. Economic duress: economic pressure

## DISCHARGE OF A CONTRACT

Discharge of a contract refers to the way in which it comes to an end.

Contracts can come to an end in the following ways:

- -by performance
- -by agreement
- -by frustration
- -by breach

## DISCHARGE BY PERFORMANCE

The contract comes to an end when both parties perform their contractual obligations.

## DISCHARGE BY AGREEMENT

The parties themselves can agree to end the contract, form a new contract or vary the original one.

- -Performance of a contract may be subject to a condition precedent allowing for discharge upon the failure of a certain event -e.g. in a contract for the sale of land where the purchaser has been unable to obtain finance.
- -A contract may contain a term that if some specified event occurs after the contract is formed then it may be terminated at the option of either or one of the parties. This is a condition subsequent e.g. the return of an item that is defective for a refund.
- -The parties may enter a new contract to end the old one. This is called novation. Obviously the new contract must satisfy all the usual rules for contractual formation.
- -The parties can also release each other from their remaining obligations -called release and discharge; or they may release each other from some of their obligations and retain or add others -called variation.

## DISCHARGE BY FRUSTRATION

A contract automatically comes to an end if it is discharged by frustration.

Four conditions must be satisfied for frustration to discharge a contract:

- -an unforeseeable event -something that the parties did not expect to happen and didn't make provision for in the contract
- -no fault of either party that makes performance impossible -i.e. death of one of the parties where personal performance is necessary; destruction of the subject matter of the contract

- -change in the law making a previously legal contract illegal
- -or radically different than agreed -i.e. due to destruction of the object or purpose of the contract

## FORCE MAJEURE CLAUSE

Common clause in contracts that essentially frees both parties from liability or obligation when an extraordinary event or circumstance beyond the control of the parties, such as a war, strike, riot, crime, or an event described by the legal term act of God (such as hurricane, flooding, earthquake, volcanic eruption, etc.), prevents one or both parties from fulfilling their obligations under the contract.

## WILL THE CONTRACT BE DISCHARGED UPON DEATH OF SELLER

The contract is not discharged upon death of seller. If the buyer is willing to wait, buyer is able to proceed with the purchase after obtaining the following. Otherwise, buyer can rescind the contract.

Seller death:

- 1) If there is a will, the court will issue a grant of probate .
- 2) If there is no will, letters of administration will substitute the term probate.

This process can last a few months to 2 years.

## DISCHARGE BY BREACH

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

Where one of the parties fails to perform their side of the contract the innocent party may be able to terminate the contract and commence proceedings for damages (or other appropriate remedy).

Not all breaches entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract. It is only breaches of conditions or fundamental breaches that allow for termination. Breaches of warranties do not allow for termination, however, the innocent party is entitled to sue for damages.

## REMEDIES OF BREACH OF CONTRACT LAW

When a contract is breached, there are specific remedies to it:

- -Damages
- -Specific performance
- -Injunction

## DAMAGES

The major remedy available at common law for breach of contract is an award of damages. This is a monetary sum fixed by the court to compensate the injured party.

In order to recover substantial damages the innocent party must show that he has suffered actual loss; if there is no actual loss he will only be entitled to nominal damages in recognition of the fact that he has a valid cause of action

In making an award of damages, the court has two major considerations:

- -Remoteness -for what consequences of the breach is the defendant legally responsible?
- -The measure of damages -the principles upon which the loss or damage is evaluated or quantified in monetary terms

## LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

If a contract includes a provision that, on a breach of contract, damages of a certain amount or calculable at a certain rate will be payable, the courts will normally accept the relevant figure as a measure of damages. Such clauses are called liquidated damages clauses . Eg, Law Society's Conditions of Sale provides a liquidated damage of 8% for delay in completion.

## SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE

- -Usually damages are granted by way or monetary compensation.
- -In general the court will only grant specific performance where it would be just and equitable to do so
- -Specific performance shall not be granted as follows:
- i. Where monetary compensation is adequate remedy.
- ii. Where contract is of personal nature.
- iii. Where the court cannot effectively supervise the execution of the contract e.g. building contract.
- iv. Where it will be inequitable e.g. against a minor.
- v. Where the contract made be the company is ultra-vies the company.
- vi. Where the contract is revocable.
- vii. Made by trustee in breach or trustship.

## INJUNCTION

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

An injunction is an order issued by a court that forces the defendant -- a person, corporation or government entity -- to do something or stop doing something, depending on what the plaintiff is requesting. In relatively rare cases, the court may issue a mandatory injunction, compelling a person, company, or governmental unit to take affirmative action in carrying out a specified action.

## CLAUSES IN CONTRACTS

Limitation Clause : a clause that limit one's damages.

Eg. This option shall expire on the Expiry Date and will become null and void if not exercised on or before the Expiry Date and the Option Money shall be forfeited to the Vendor.

Disclaimer Clause : a clause that disclaim one from being sued due to mistakes made on printing materials.

E.g.. While we make every effort to ensure that all information displayed herein is accurate and complete, we provide it for information purposes only and it is therefore indicative

rather than definitive. We thus do not guarantee its accuracy, whether explicit or implicit, and we do not accept responsibility for any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, or for any loss which might result directly or indirectly from reliance on the content it contains. We reserve the right to correct or update content at any time without prior notification.

Indemnity Clause : a clause to indemnify the other party for breach of contract or tort.

Eg. The Tenant will indemnify the Landlord in respect of all liabilities costs and expenses suffered or incurred by the Landlord in its capacity as Landlord of the site arising from any negligent act or omission by the Tenant in the exercise of the rights granted by this Lease or by reason of any non observance or non performance of the Tenant's covenants and obl igations herein.

Exclusion Clause : a clause to restrict the rights of the parties to the contract. The clause recognizes a potential breach of contract, and then excuses liability for the breach.

Eg. The laundry shall not be responsible for any damage howsoever arising.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES:

At the end of this unit, you should be able to:

- Apply the fundamental knowledge of the following in the context of real estate agency:
- o Meaning and creation of agency relationships (including the use of prescribed Estate Agency Agreements).
- o Differences between exclusive and non-exclusive agency.
- o Agency as a contract uberrimae fidei, i.e. contract of the utmost good faith.
- o Agent's authorities as viewed by principal and third party.
- o Rights and duties between principal and agent (e.g. right to commission and duty to transmit all offers) and to third party.
- o Termination of agency relationships.
- o Remedies for breach of duties by principal, agent or third party.

## GENERAL AGENCY PRACTICE

Agency: Describes the relationship that exists where one party, the agent, acts on behalf of another, the principal, to create a legal relationship with a third party.

## 3 Parties:

1. Principal: Vendor/Landlord

2. Third Party : Buyer/Tenant

3. Agent: Real Estate Agent/Salesperson

In practice, there are many examples of agency relationships such as: estate agents and travel agents.

## CREATION OF AGENCY

- -Agency relationship cannot be created unilaterally
- -Both parties must consent
- -Principal must allow the agent to represent him and to be bound by contracts entered into on his behalf by the agent.
- -Legal language or even knowledge that they are creating an agency relationship is not necessary

## UNIT 2.2: LAW OF AGENCY

## AGENCY BY CONSENT/AGREEMENT

Most common method by which an agency relationship comes into being between estate agents and their principals.

Consent may be express or implied.

An agency can be expressly created either orally or in writing.

In commercial transactions it is usual (but not essential) to appoint an agent in writing, so that the terms and extent of the relationship are set down to avoid misunderstanding. Oral and implied contracts of agency is difficult to enforce.

For real estate work in Singapore, it is prudent to have CEA's prescribed Estate Agency Agreements signed.  They are:

- -Estate Agency Agreement for the Sale of Residential Property
- -Estate Agency Agreement for the Purchase of Residential Property
- -Estate Agency Agreement for the Lease of Residential Property by a Landlord
- -Estate Agency Agreement for the Lease of Residential Property by a Tenant
- -Exclusive Estate Agency Agreement for the Sale of Residential Property
- -Exclusive Estate Agency Agreement for the Purchase of Residential Property
- -Exclusive Estate Agency Agreement for the Lease of Residential Property by a Landlord
- -Exclusive Estate Agency Agreement for the Lease of Residential Property by a Tenant

The 8 prescribed documents can be found on CEA's website.

## AGENCY BY ESTOPPEL (OR 'HOLDING OUT')

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

Agency by estoppel arises when:

- Words or conduct of the principal give to a third party the impression that the person who purports to contract with the third party is the agent of the principal, and

- The third party, as a result, acts upon this.

The principal is 'estopped', or prevented, from denying the existence of the agency.

Agency by estoppel can only arise where the conduct of the apparent principal creates it. Agency does not arise by estoppel if it is the 'agent' who holds himself out as agent, not the 'principal'.

## AGENCY BY RATIFICATION

In certain circumstances the relationship of principal and agent can be created or extended with retrospective effect, that is, once the contract has been entered into by the agent and third party.

Ratification only validates past acts of the purported agent. It gives no authority for the future.

Thus, where A makes a contract on behalf of P at a time when A has no authority from P, P may later ratify the contract. This will have the retrospective effect of establishing an agency as at the time the contract was made. All parties are then in the same position as if the principal had been the original contracting party, ie the principal may sue or be sued by the third party and the agent no longer has any liability.

The principal may only ratify if the following conditions are satisfied:

- -The principal must have been in existence at the time of the agent's act .
- -The principal must have the legal capacity to make the contract himself, both at the time the act was carried out and at the time of the purported ratification.
- -The agent must, at the time of making the contract, either n ame or sufficiently identify the principal on whose behalf he is making the contract.

The principal must ratify the contract within a reasonable time and a ratification of part of the contract will operate as a ratification of the entire contract (ie the principal cannot just select such parts of the contract as he considers to be to his advantage). In order to ratify the contract, the principal must communicate a sufficiently clear intention of ratifying , either by express words or by conduct, such as refusing to return goods purchased for him by an agent who lacked authority. Mere passive inactivity will not amount to ratification.

## AGENCY OF NECESSITY

An agency of necessity is another way in which an agency can arise by operation of law. Its origins can be found in mercantile law, and in shipping law in particular. It may arise where a person is faced with an emergency in which the property or interests of another person are in imminent jeopardy and, in order to preserve that property or those interests, it becomes necessary to act for that person without his authority. An agency of necessity probably only applies where there is already some existing contractual relationship between the parties, as the law is highly unlikely to allow a person to be bound by the act of a complete stranger.

An agent who seeks to bind a principal on the grounds of an agency of necessity will need to show that:

- -The agent had no practical way of contacting the principal in order to obtain the principal's instructions
- -His actions arose from some pressing need for action (usually an emergency of some kind, involving perishable goods or starving animals, for example)
- -He acted in good faith in the interests of the principal rather than in his own interests, and
- -His action was reasonable and prudent in the circumstances.

## TYPES OF AGENCY

The common types of agency appointment are:

- -Non exclusive agency: owner is open to deal with any agent who can introduce buyers/tenants
- -Sole agency: owner appoints only 1 agent, but owner reserves the right to market the propery himself
- -Exclusive agency: owner appoints only 1 agent to market the property. If owner were to sellthe property himeself or through another agenty, there must be compensation to the exclusive agent

## CONTRACT UBERRIMAE FIDEI

Uberrimae fidei is a Latin phrase meaning "utmost good faith" (literally, "most abundant faith"). Uberrimae fidei contracts are made in utmost good faith. There is no concealment or deception in such contracts. If one of the parties to a contract has a special knowledge, he/she must disclose such knowledge relevant to the contract. Although all contracts are to be made in utmost good faith, insurance contracts are very strict in this regard. Failure to disclose these facts will make the contract voidable.

## A GENT'S AUTHORITY

The contract made by the agent is binding on the principal and the other party only if the agent was acting within the limits of his authority from his principal.

3 sources of authority:

- -Actual express authority
- -Actual implied authority
- -Ostensible or apparent authority

## ACTUAL EXPRESS AUTHORITY

This is authority explicitly given by the principal to the agent to make a particular contract either orally or in writing.

## ACTUAL IMPLIED AUTHORITY

Authority may also be implied from the nature of the agent's activities or from what is usual in the circumstances.

Implied authority cannot be contrary to authority expressly given.

Thus an agent also has actual implied authority

- To do all things that are incidental to the actions expressly authorised
- To do all things that are usual by virtue of the agent's office.

Eg, an agent appointed to sell a property will also have implied incidental authority to advertise the car for sale.

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## OSTENSIBLE OR APPARENT AUTHORITY

The ostensible (or apparent) authority of an agent is that which his principal represents to other persons (with whom the agent deals) that he has given to the agent. As a result, an agent with limited actual authority can be held in practice to have a more extensive authority.

The representation must be made to the third party and it must be shown that the third party relied on the representation . If there is no causal link between the third party's loss and his reliance upon the representation, the third party will not be able to hold the principal liable.

If a principal creates the impression that an agent is authorized but there is no actual authority, third parties are protected so long as they have acted reasonably. This is sometimes termed "agency by estoppel" or the "doctrine of holding out", where the principal will be estopped from denying the grant of authority if third parties have changed their positions to their detriment in reliance on the representations made.

## BREACH OF WARRANTY OF AUTHORITY

Agent is in breach of warranty of authority when he enters into a contract with a third party (for and on behalf of a principal) where he has no authority to do so, creating an impression

## LIMITS OF AN AGENT'S AUTHORITY

Agent can:

- -Describe  and discuss all the relevant aspects of the property
- -CANNOT sign on or behalf of the principle, unless Power of Attorney is given
- -CANNOT receive money/deposit in agent's name

87

UNIT 2.2: LAW OF AGENCY

## RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF AGENTS

## DUTIES OF AN ESTATE AGENT

## DUTY TO ACT OR PERFORM THE CONTRACT OF AGENCY

- -Under duty to act for the benefit of his principal in the way which he has been commissioned to do
- -If it is or becomes impossible to carry out what he has been commissioned to do, he must inform his principal accordingly.
- -However, where an agent is not receiving a fee to perform a specified function, but is entitled to a fee or commission conditional upon his fulfilment of a task (e.g. finalizing a sale at a minimum specified price), it is currently unclear whether he will be in breach of duty if he does not act (e.g. he does not do anything at all to attempt to secure a sale).
- -While a real estate agent is not in breach of duty if he fails to sell a house, he will normally be obliged to make reasonable endeavours to do so. This is particularly the case in relation to sole agencies, since a sole agent impliedly promises to use his best endeavours to bring about a sale, and could thus be sued for breach of contract if he did nothing.

- -An agent acts in culpable ignorance when he consciously has no knowledge of the truth or falsity of a particular matter but nevertheless makes representations without regard for their accuracy, e.g. where an agent is asked if the house is connected to the sewer system and he replies in the affirmative even though he has no knowledge, or is not certain, of this fact.

## DUTY TO EXERCISE CARE AND SKILL

- -Agent must exercise due care and skill, e.g. in ensuring accuracy of the information he provides, or he may be liable for negligence.

## RIGHTS OF AN ESTATE AGENT

## RIGHT TO REMUNERATION

Agent is only entitled to remuneration for his services as an agent if the terms of the agency agreement provides.

If it is not expressly provided in the agency agreement for payment of remuneration to the agent, and there is a dispute between the principal and agent as to the right to claim any remuneration and the amount and terms of payment of such remuneration, the court may have to determine if, on the facts of the case, there are any implied terms in respect of the same in the agency agreement.

In the business world, if services are rendered by the agent and accepted by the principal, there is often an implied term that the agent may be entitled to reasonable remuneration for such services rendered, even if there is no express agreement for the payment of remuneration.

Where it is expressly provided that remuneration is payable upon the happening of an event (for example, on successful completion of a transaction), the agent is not entitled to claim the remuneration until that event has actually occurred. And if the event specified does not occur, the agent will not be entitled to claim any remuneration even if he has spent time and effort in trying to bring about the event.

Subject to any special terms in the agency agreement, where the remuneration of an agent is a commission on a transaction to be brought about by the agent, the agent is not entitled to such commission unless his services are the effective cause of the transaction being brought about. The real question is whether the agent's action and services actually and directly bring about the contractual relation between the principal and the third party. The agent's action and services must not have been merely incidental.

## RIGHT TO REIMBURSEMENT AND INDEMNITY

Generally, an agent has a right to be reimbursed by his principal for all expenses and to be indemnified against all losses and liabilities incurred by him in the performance of his duties to the principal.

When an agent carries out his duties according to the principal's instructions and in the course of which he incurs expenses, he is normally entitled to reimbursement by the principal of such expenses, as long as they are reasonable. Expenses may include items such as travelling expenses, photocopying charges, fees for registration of documents payable to government departments, etc.

## REMEDIES FOR BREACH

Where there is breach

- -Agent are not entitled to comission
- -Third party can sue Principal under tort (vicarious liability) for damages
- -Principal can sue agent for damages

## TERMINATION OF AGENCY

An agency relationship can be terminated at any time by:

## -Agreement

Relationship can also be brought to an end by mutual agreement between the parties, either in writing or orally.

Can also occur in the following situations:

- -If the agreement provides for the appointment of the agent for a specified period of time, the agency will come to an end automatically when that period of time expires.
- -If the agreement provides for the agency to terminate upon the occurrence of a specified event, the agency will come to an end upon the happening of the specified event

## -Act of the parties

- -Performance by the agent

If an agent is appointed to accomplish a particular task or for a specific purpose, when the task is accomplished by the agent or the specific purpose is attained, the agency will terminate.

- -Revocation by principal
- -The authority of an agent may be revoked at any time by the principal. However, unilateral revocation otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the agency agreement may render the principal liable to the agent for breach of the agency agreement.
- -Any word or conduct of the principal inconsistent with the continued exercise of authority by the agent may operate as revocation of the agency.
- -Revocation of the agent's power by the principal may not automatically discharge the principal from liability to a third party who is entitled to rely on the apparent authority of the agent on grounds of representation by the principal or previous course of dealing with the agent before notice of revocation is given to the third party. Therefore, notice of revocation of an agent's power should be given to the third party as soon as possible.
- -Renunciation by agent
- -An agent is entitled to renounce his power by refusing to act or by notifying the principal that he will not act for the principal.

- -Unilateral termination of the agency by the agent before he has fulfilled his obligations to the principal under the agency agreement will render the agent liable to the principal for breach of the agency agreement, such as payment of damages for loss suffered by the principal.
- -By notice
- -If the agency agreement provides that the agency may be terminated upon either party serving on the other written notice of a specified duration, for example, three months' written notice, either party may terminate the agency agreement by serving the required notice on the other party.
- -However, if the agency agreement does not contain any termination provision, the general rule is that reasonable notice has to be given to the other party to terminate the agency.
- -By operation of law
- -Upon the following situation of the parties involved:
- -Death
- -Insanity
- -bankruptcy
- -Frustration of the contract of agency

## UNIT 2.3: LANDLORD AND TENANT LAW

## LEARNING OUTCOME:

At the end of this unit, you should be able to:

- Understand a lease as an interest in land and its implications (cross-refer to Paper 1, Unit 1.3).
- Explain the dual relationship between landlord and tenant: privity of contract and privity of estate, and the implications on the binding effect of their covenants on assignees.
- Distinguish fixed term lease, periodic lease, tenancy at sufferance and tenancy at will.
- Understand the essential elements of a lease and the formalities required.

- Understand option to renew and circumstances leading to the determination of a lease.
- Understand what rights and duties are implied by law on the part of the landlord and tenant respectively.
- Explain commonly expressed terms/ covenants.
- Understand the remedies available for breach of term/covenant.

## LEASES

Lease is an interest in land giving the tenant/lessee exclusive possession for a fixed period of a certain duration, usually in consideration of a payment termed 'rent' .

Singapore laws relating to landlords and tenants are mainly derived from statutory provisions under the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, Chapter 61 ('CLPA') and under common law which is based historically on English laws.

## ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF A TENANCY

- -Tenant has exclusive possession of the property.
- -Teancy runs for a certain or fixed period of time .
- -Landlord's right s are subject to the tenancy .
- -Landlord has reversionary interest of the property upon termination of the tenancy.

## LEASE VS LICENCE

Interest in property: License is a contractual right to do something on a property, whereas a lease is a property interest that includes possession of the property

Exclusive possession : Tenant has exclusive possession in a lease, but a licence do not confer this right on licensee

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## TYPES OF LEASE

## FIXED-TERM LEASE

- Lasts for a fixed period of time

- Has a definite beginning date and a definite ending date

- fixed term tenancy comes to an end automatically when the fixed term runs out

## PERIODIC TENANCY

- A periodic tenancy also known as a tenancy from year to year, month to month, or week to week

- Exists for some period of time determined by the term of the payment of rent.

- Either the landlord or the tenant may terminate a periodic tenancy when the period or term is nearing completion, by giving notice to the other party

## TENANCY AT WILL

- A tenancy at will is a tenancy which either the landlord or the tenant may terminate at any time by giving reasonable notice.

- Unlike a periodic tenancy, it isn't associated with a time period.

- Could be ended at any time by either the lessor or the lessee for any reason, or for no reason at all.

- Proper notice must be given

## TENANCY AT SUFFERANCE

- A tenancy at sufferance (sometimes called a holdover tenancy) exists when a tenant remains in possession of a property after the expiration of a lease, and until the landlord acts to eject the tenant from the property.

- Although the tenant is technically a trespasser at this point, and possession of this type is not a true estate in land, authorities recognise the condition in order to hold the tenant liable for rent.

- Landlord may evict such a tenant at any time, and without notice.

- Landlord may also impose a new lease on the holdover tenant.

## TERMS IN A LEASE

A lease agreement consist of the following:

- -Premises: Includes the date, name of parties and address of the property concerned
- -Habendum: Meaning 'to have and to hold', indicates the commencement and duration of the lease term
- -Reddendum: Rent clause in the lease. Includes rent amount, deposit, service charge, rent review
- -Convenants: Expressed and inplied covenants
- -Conditions
- -Warranty

A copy of a Sample TA with all the terms can be found in the Appendix.

## OPTION TO RENEW

Option to renew a lease allows tenant to continue to occupy the premises after the initial term of lease expires.

Tenants have no automatic entitlement to renewal of a lease. It must be a specific 'option to renew' clause is contained in the lease.

## Clause must state:

- -notice to exercise the option to renew the lease,
- -how it should be exercised, eg in writing,
- -the notice is served in accordance with the lease; and
- -conditions that must be fulfilled.

## DIPLOMATIC OR REPATRIATE CLAUSE

This clause is to safeguard the tenant if they are no longer employed, transferred to other countries.

Tenant can terminate the lease after 12 months by giving 2 months notice. The security deposit will be refunded.

## RENT REVIEW CLAUSE

Rent reviews take place at whatever intervals are agreed in the lease. Their purpose is usually to adjust the rent to the current market level at the review date.

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## RIGHTS AND DUTIES IN TENANCY RELATIONSHIP

Although the rights and obligations of the tenant and landlord are expressly provided in the lease agreement, common law will imply certain rights even if they are not specified.

## LANDLORD'S COVENANT

- Quiet enjoyment of the premises, which means tenant can enjoy the use of the premises without interference.

- No derogation from the grant, landlord must observe all the terms granted to tenant.

- Property must be fit for habitation at the start of the lease term

- -Landlord or his agents at all reasonable times during the term, with workmen and others and all necessary materials and appliances, enter upon the leased premises for the purpose of complying with any written law affecting the premises and with any notices served by any public authority involving the carrying out of repairs or the doing of any work or other act which the tenant may not be bound, or, if bound, may neglect to do. Repairs, work or other acts carried out or done must not interfere with the occupation and use of the premises by the lessee;
- -Landlord may re-enter the leased premises:
- o when the rent is in arrear for 30 days (although no formal demand therefor has been made);

- o the repairs required by a notice are not completed within the time therein specified

However this does not release tenant from liability in respect of the breach or nonobservance of any such covenant, condition or stipulation.

## TERMINATION OF A LEASE

1. By expiry of the fixed term in the Lease Agreement

A lease automatically terminates when the term has expired, unless there is an option to renew for a further period which was exercised by the Tenant.

2. By express power

This is where a clause is provided in the agreement allowing either party to terminate the lease before the end of the fixed term on the happening of certain events.

3. By surrender of the unexpired term

This occurs when the tenant gives notice to the landlord that he will surrender the lease even though the term of the lease has not yet expired, and the landlord accepts the surrender of the lease. The surrender can be by express words of the tenant or by operation of law. The latter happens if the tenant either accepts a new lease or gives up possession of the premises even though he does not have to.

4. By forfeiture

This is where a term of the lease allows the landlord to end the lease in the event of certain breaches by the tenant, for example, using the premises for an unlawful purpose.

5. By notice to quit

In any lease including one for a fixed term, there must be a clause clearly allowing for this right to be exercised.

Under section 72 of the CLPA, any notice to be given under a lease must be in writing, including a notice to quit.

## RELIEF NON-PAYMENT OF RENT

The action must be brought within six years of the date that the arrears became due.

## 1) Distress Act

Tenant's goods are seized and sold, and the rent owing must not exceed 12 months of the tenancy.

## Procedure:

- -File writ of distress that is addressed to the sheriff.
- -Sheriff seize the goods, and make an inventory and a valuation.
- -Notice given to tenant on the seizure, informing him of the rent owed and that the goods seized will be sold at a stated place and time.
- -Such a notice pasted in a conspicuous place on the premises.
- -Tenant has five days to pay up from the date of notice or to apply to court for an order to stop the sale.
- -On the tenant's application, the court may order that the goods be released unconditionally, direct that an issue be tried and so suspend the writ, or hold that the goods may be sold.
- -If no application is made, the goods will be sold and the proceeds applied first to pay the sheriff's costs and then to satisfy the outstanding rent. The balance, if any, would be returned to the tenant.
- -Where the tenant has abandoned the premises and there is insufficient property for distress, then if (a) the rent is not less than 75 per cent of the annual value of the property and (b) the rent has been in arrears for at least two months, the landlord may apply to court to enter and take possession of the premises.
- -Sheriff will paste a notice informing the tenant that possession will be given to the landlord unless the tenant applies within 10 days, or the court orders otherwise, on the application of the tenant or some other interested party.
- -If the distress action is brought after bankruptcy proceedings have started against the tenant, then only three months of arrears of rent are recoverable against him. The landlord may also file a proof of debt with the Official Assignee against the bankrupt tenant, just as he could with any other unsecured creditor.

## 2) Forfeiture of lease

The landlord may also apply for forfeiture of the lease, which would effectively bring the lease to an end.

## Tenant get relief from forfeiture

- -by paying into court all the arrears of rent and costs within 4 weeks of notice and can continue with the lease and not have to enter into a new lease.

## DOCTRINE OF WASTE

Waste is any alteration or damage to land by an occupier of the land and can be brought to court to address the change in condition.

## PERMISSIVE WASTE

- Occupier allows the land to fall into disrepair.

- A person is not usually liable for permissive waste.

- Liability to repair can be imposed by the instrument creating the relationship between the occupier of the land and the person whose interest in the land is being infringed

## VOLUNTARY WASTE

- A positive act, where the occupier does something intentionally to damage the land. For instance, a tenant is liable for voluntary waste unless excused by the lease

## EQUITABLE WASTE

- Waste by an occupier, which is so serious that it will be restrained in equity, because it is an act of 'wanton destruction' and a Court will not allow a party to a contract to act against conscience by engaging in acts of 'wanton destruction'

- It should, however, be noted that a life tenant can be excuse from liability for even equitable waste by the instrument creating the relationship

## AMELIORATING WASTE

- Waste that improves the land.

- Although the person, whose interest in the land is to be infringed, has not suffered loss, a Court will nevertheless restrain the act of waste. The court, however, will only intervene where the ameliorating waste is of a 'substantially injurious character'.

## ASSIGNMENT OF THE LEASE

An Assignment of Lease may be executed in a situation where an existing landlord assigns all the tenancy rights to the new owner who has purchased the property subject to tenancy.

Assignment of rights under a contract is the complete transfer of the rights to receive the benefits accruing to one of the parties to that contract.

Assignment only transfers the rights/benefits to a new owner. The obligations remain with the previous owner.

## NOVATION

A Novation document may be executed in a situation where an existing tenant assigns all the tenancy rights to an incoming tenant.

- -Novation replaces the original party with a new party.
- -For a valid novation
- o all parties must assent to novation,
- o there must be a previously valid contract,
- o the duties provided for in the contract be extinguished immediately, and
- o a new, enforceable contract need be created
- -E.g. in tenancy agreements, tenant finds a new tenant with landlord's consent. Novation agreement is signed, with incoming tenant taking over the obligations of the tenancy.

## SUBLETTING OF THE LEASE

In sub-letting, the tenant relinquishes only some part of the leased property.

Tenant will still be responsible to the landlord in terms of his lease obligations and for what the subtenant does. The landlord does not have anything to do with the sub-tenant except for giving approval for the sub-letting. The landlord will hold the tenant responsible of any wrong doing of the sub-tenant.

## PRIVITY OF CONTRACT

- Principle of privity states that only parties to contract can sue and be sued on contract

- Only contractual parties can use the contract to sue each other

## PRIVITY OF ESTATE

- Situations where it is possible for third party whose name is not in the contract but has interest in the property to sue based on the contract

- E.g. Buyer who buys with tenancy: Law binds the new landlord and tenant via Privity of Estate

## LEARNING OUTCOME:

At the end of this unit, you should be able to:

- Distinguish the tort of negligence from negligent misrepresentation.
- Appreciate when a duty of care exists and whether it can be varied expressly.
- Assess the standard of care required in estate agency work.
- List and explain the remedies for breach of duty of care.

## LAW OF TORT

- -Tort: a civil wrong which does not depend on an agreement between the parties.
- -Arises in situations where the law holds one party responsible to another party.

## DEFINITION OF NEGLIGENCE

Negligence is a tort which targets a breach of duty by one person to another.

Elements of negligence are:

- -A duty of care (Neighbour principle)
- -Breach of that duty (Objective test)
- -Breach causing harm in fact (But for test)
- -Harm must not be too remote as a consequence of the breach.

## DUTY OF CARE

An individual may be owed a duty of care by another, to ensure that they do not suffer any unreasonable harm or loss. If such a duty is found to be breached, a legal liability is imposed upon the duty-ower, to compensate the victim for any losses they incur.

Establishment of a duty of care:

- -Concept of reasonable foreseeability of harm
- -Relationship of proximity
- -Fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant for his careless actions

## UNIT 2.4: NEGLIGENCE

## THE NEIGHBOUR PRINCIPLE

The rule that one must  love one's neighbour becomes in law one must not injure one's neighbor.

Who is my neighbour?

Persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions that are called in question.

## BREACH OF THE DUTY OF CARE

In order to establish whether a duty of care has been breached the court will look first of all at the standard of care that is expected in the circumstances.

The standard of care is determined by looking at what a ' reasonable man' would have done (or not done) in the same circumstances. (Objective test)

Where a defendant has acted in an unreasonable way or their actions fell well below the standard expected they will be found to have breached their duty of care.

Where the defendant was in a special profession, e.g. being a doctor, the court will ask what standard of care a "reasonable doctor" or the like might have done. No allowance is made for other personal circumstances, such as the fact that the defendant was inexperienced in the task he set out to perform. He is expected to perform this task as a reasonably skilled and competent person.

For real estate, a standard of care will include:

- -Salesperson giving advice should have knowledge of the property market
- -Agent knows that client would act on such advice

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## CAUSATION

Basic test for establishing causation is the "but-for" test in which the defendant will be liable only if the claimant's damage would not have occurred "but for" his negligence.

The claimant must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the defendant' s negligence caused or materially contributed to the injury or loss sustained.

## REMOTENESS OF DAMAGE

The damage suffered by the claimant must not be too remote, which means that it must be reasonably foreseeable. This is an objective test, and the defendant is only responsible for the damage which a reasonable man would have foreseen as a likely consequence of his action.

## DEFENCES

3 defences which may be raised against an action for a claim of damages resulting from negligence of the defendant are:

- -Contributory Negligence
- -Volenti Non Fit Injuria
- -Illegality

## CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE

- -applies to cases where a plaintiff/claimant has, through his own negligence, contributed to the harm he suffered.
- -claimant's damages are reduced in accordance with the percentage of contribution made by the claimant to the loss or damage suffered.

## VOLENTI NON FIT INJURIA

- -Latin for "to the willing, no injury is done"
- -If someone willingly places themselves in a position where harm might result, knowing that some degree of harm might result, they will not be able to bring a claim against the other party in tort

## ILLEGALITY

- -Ex turpi causa non oritur actio: Latin for "no right of action arises from a despicable cause".
- -If the claimant is involved in wrongdoing at the time the alleged negligence occurred, this may extinguish or reduce the defendant's liability.

## REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF DUTY OF CARE

- -Damages
- -Law of negligence awards compensation based on culpability meaning who is at fault

## NEGLIGENCE VS NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION

Professional Negligence: Breach of fiduciary duty and Duty of Care

Negligent Misrepresentation: Giving wrong factual information carelessly

## UNIT 2.5: CONVEYANCE INTER VIVOS

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

This topic is pertinent to estate agents and salespersons and the scope is extensive. It will be dealt with in detail in Paper 2, Competency Unit 4.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES:

At the end of this unit, you should be able to

- Understand the nature of mortgage as a security.
- Ascertain the existence of a legal mortgage on a property title.
- Explain the mortgagor's right to redeem and to lease the property, and the actions that the mortgagee may take on the mortgagor's default.
- Understand the priority of mortgages and charges e.g. a charge by CPF Board.
- Explain fixed rate and floating rate mortgages.

## MORTGAGE

A mortgage occurs when an owner (mortgagor) pledges his or her interest (right to the property) as security or collateral to a financial institution (mortgagee) for a loan.

- -Mortgages have an interest rate and are scheduled to amortize over a set period of time.
- -The mortgagee will return the interest to the mortgagor after the loan has been repaid.

Basic components of mortgages:

- -Loan amount: you can loan up to 80% of the valuation of the property, or sale price, whichever is lower.
- -Interest: Interest rate can be
- o fixed rate,
- o flexible rate, or
- o a combination of both over the duration of the loan.
- -Term: duration of the loan (typically between 15-30 years)

Mortgage is also usually the cheapest financing available for people (e.g. compared to personal loans).

## UNIT 2.6: MORTGAGE

## LEGAL ASPECTS

Mortgages may be legal or equitable.

Legal mortgage : gives the mortgagee rights over the property, such as the right to gain ownership over the real estate or to execute a sale of the property. However, until the mortgagee chooses to exercise the rights, the mortgagor possesses the legal ownership of the property.  Also, to provide safety to the mortgagee, the details of mortgage are recorded in a register.

Equitable mortgage : an agreement relating to the deposit of title deeds of the property to secure the financing from the mortgagee.

Generally, the main difference between a legal and an equitable mortgage is that an equitable mortgage loses priority to a subsequent legal mortgage if the subsequent mortgagee was a purchaser for value in good faith without actual or constructive notice of the prior equitable mortgage.

## RULES OF PRIORITY

Under the Land Titles Act, priority is determined according to the date of registration of the legal mortgage, followed by equitable mortgages.

When a property is sold, the money received are discharged in the following order:

1. Paymet for all costs and expenses incidental to the sale
2. Discharge of mortgage money, interest  and costs secured by mortgage
3. Payment of subsequent mortgages and charges (if any) in order of their priority

When a property is purchased with a loan with banks or HDB and CPF monies, the priority of charges are:

1. Paymet for all costs and expenses incidental to the sale
2. Discharge of mortgage money, interest  and costs secured by banks/HDB
3. Payment of CPF monies
4. Any charges (if any) in order of their priority

## RIGHTS OF THE MORTGAGOR (BORROWER)

- -Right of Redemption: entitles the mortgagor to call for the re-transfer ownership to the mortgagor when the secured debt is satisfied
- -Right to sell the property: Mortgagor can sell the property
- -Right to grant lease

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## RIGHTS OF THE MORTGAGEE (LENDER)

When the mortgagor defaults, the mortgagee (bank, financial institute) has the following rights:

- -Entry into Possession
- -Power of sale: Provided notice given and mortgagor fails to pay up after 3 months from notice
- -Appointment of a Receiver
- -Foreclosure

## COMMON TYPES OF MORTGAGES IN SINGAPORE

There can be many variations of mortgage packages offered by financial institutions in Singapore. Below is a list of common ones found in Singapore.

## STANDARD MORTGAGE (CAPITAL AND INTEREST)

Borrowers make payment for both the interest and the principal monthly.

Monthly payments are usually the same throughout the loan period.   During the early years, a bigger proportion of the installments will go towards interest payments. And the principal payment portion gradually grows larger over the loan term. At the end of the loan term, the debt would have been fully repaid.

## INTEREST-ONLY MORTGAGE

There are no payments towards the principal throughout partial or whole loan term .

Only pay for the interests of the loan .

The full loan principal is then paid off at the end of the loan period .

## FIXED RATE MORTGAGE

Fixed rate packages offer a fixed interest rate for a certain period, eg 1/2/3-year lock-in, after which it becomes a floating rate loan.

Fixed rate loans also typically come with a lock-in period and early repayment penalties.

## VARIABLE RATE MORTGAGE

Interest rate will fluctuate during the loan term.

Based on reference rate, eg the SIBOR ( Singapore Inter Bank Offered Rate) or the bank's board rate.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES:

At the end of this unit, you should be able to

- Explain the formalities and the effect of a gift of property.
- Explain what makes a gift void or voidable under the Bankruptcy Act.

## GIFTS OF PROPERTY

A gift, in the law of property, is the voluntary transfer of property from one person (the donor or grantor) to another (the donee or grantee) without consideration of money .

Deed of Gift has to be drafted by lawyer.

Gifts can be either:

- lifetime gifts - a gift of a present or future interest made and delivered in the donor's lifetime; or
- Testamentary gifts -A Testamentary gift is a gift made by will. Such gifts do not become effective until the death of the donor. The ownership of the gift is transferred to the donee only after the testator's death.
- If the Donor (person giving the property) is bankrupt within 2 years from the date of the Deed of Gift, the gift becomes absolutely void as against the Official Assignee (section 98 of the Bankruptcy Act)
- Up to a period of 5 years from the date of the Deed of Gift, the Grantor's bankruptcy will make the instrument voidable at the option of the Official Assignee only being rebuttable on evidence being furnished of the Grantor's solvency at the date of the gift (section 52 of the Bankruptcy Act, Cap. 20)

- Explain trust, and alienation by way of trust inter vivos or by succession.
- Understand the implications of buying property held on trust.

## TRUSTS

A fiduciary relationship in which one party, known as a trustor, gives another party, the trustee, the right to hold title to property or assets for the benefit of a third party , the beneficiary.

Eg, a trust can be used if a beneficiary is under age or has a mental disability that impairs the person's ability to maintain his or her own real estate. Once the beneficiary is deemed able to manage the real estate by the terms dictated under the trust, the beneficiary will receive possession of the trust .

Deed of Trust : Document that lay out the conditions of the trustor-trustee relationship .

Trustees have the right to make decisions based on due diligence and in the best interest of the beneficiary, and can be held personally liable for their actions if the beneficiary deems there was a breach of trust .

When buying properties held in trust, ensure that trustee has the right to make decisions.  It is important to ensure who has the legal interest and deal with the person who has the legal interest of the land.

In Singapore property ownership where foreigners are restricted from buying properties, a Singaporean cannot buy a landed property and hold it in trust on behalf of the foreigner.  Such trust is illegal and un-enforceable.

## HOW IS A TRUST CREATED?

By 3 ways:

- -Express intentions of the trustor

Inter Vivos Trust: Trust established by a living person for the benefit of another, such as a trust established by a parent for an offspring.

- -Will of the trustor

Testamentary trust: created by a will going into effect only when the will maker dies.

- -Operation of law

Implied trusts -resulting and constructive trust.

## TYPES OF TRUST IMPLIED BY LAW

Resulting Trust -the true purchaser paid the price of the property but registered it in another person's name . But under the Residential Property Act, Singaporeans are not allowed to hold restricted property on trust for any foreigner. Any such trust is null and void

Constructive Trust -eg. Misappropriated company's money to buy property under one's name

Unregistered Trust -seller is holding the property on trust during transitional period before completion

## ESTATE DUTY:

No longer applicable with effect from 15 February 2008.

Estate duty or sometimes called death duty is a tax levied on the market value of properties (both movable and immovable) that pass upon the death of the person domiciled in Singapore.

## SYARIAH LAW ON INHERITANCE

In Singapore, the estate of a Muslim must be distributed in accordance with Islamic inheritance laws.

Under Section 115(1) of the Administration of Muslim Law Act, the beneficiaries must apply to the President of the Syariah Court for an Inheritance Certificate to establish the share of each beneficiary. Muslims can only dispose of or give away 1/3 of their estate to persons who are not already entitled under the Inheritance Certificate mentioned above.

## REAL PROPERTY

If the property of the deceased, be it a HDB property or private property, is held by the deceased and other parties as tenants-in-common , then it is clear that the deceased's share in the property is to be divided according to his Will and/or Faraid.

All properties, regardless of whether they are private properties or say, HDB properties, if shared through a joint tenancy, which is probably the case for most estates, will now give effect to the right of survivorship as per the civil law position. This is the current state of the law in relation to joint tenancies for Muslim estates.

An updated Fatwa which followed on the 3 April 2010 on joint tenancy, has suggested the use of Islamic legal instruments in the form of a nuzriah or the 'hibah ruqbah' and so forth, to affirm and facilitate the intention of a party in a joint tenancy to give effect to the right of survivorship in the event of his/her demise.

The updated Fatwa also says that in cases where a party who solely inherits a property in a joint tenancy but nevertheless wishes to distribute the deceased's share according to Faraid can still do so. In such a situation, the surviving joint tenant is not obliged in any way to dispose of the said property immediately just so he/she can make the distribution to the Faraid beneficiaries.

For more information regarding of the joint tenancy issue, please refer to MUIS website at www.muis.gov.sg.

## UNIT 2.10: FUTURE INTERESTS

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## LEARNING OUTCOMES:

At the end of this unit, you should be able to

- Explain what constitutes a future interest.

- Distinguish reversionary interest from remainder interest of a life estate.

## FUTURE INTEREST

Future interest is a legal right to property ownership that does not include the right to present possession or enjoyment of the property.

## REVERSIONARY INTEREST

Any future interest kept by a person who transfers property to another .

Eg developer bought condominium land and was granted 99-year lease.  After 99-year lease is up, the land shall return to the state .

A reversion occurs when a property owner makes an effective transfer of property to another but retains some future right to the property .

Eg, if James transfers a piece of property to Kenny for life, Kenny has the use of the property for the rest of his life. Upon his death, the property reverts, or goes back, to James, or if James has died, it goes to his heirs.  This is also commonly known as 'LIFE ESTATE '. In this case, James maintains his reversionary interests .

## LIFE ESTATE

Designate the ownership of land for the duration of a person's life.

An estate in real property that ends at death when there is a "reversion" to the original owner. The owner of a life estate is called a "life tenant'

For example, a deed stating that land would go "to Amy for life, then to Beth" gives Amy a valid life estate, and Beth a remainder.  Amy could use the land during her lifetime, and even sell her interest to a third party, but that third party would have to surrender the property to Beth upon Amy's death.

Amy is said to hold the life interest whilst Beth the remainder interest.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES:

At the end of this unit, you should be able to

- Distinguish between the two forms of co-ownership: joint tenancy and tenancy in common.
- Explain how tenancy in common may be created at law and in equity.

## CO-OWNERSHIP OF LAND

Two or more people may share ownership of a property.

There are two different ways to share:

- i. Joint Tenancy
- ii. Tenancy in common

## JOINT TENANCY

Land is conveyed to 2 or more persons without indication that they are to take distinct shares . Each owner is presumed to have an equal share in the property, unless proven otherwise.

Separate rights but as against all other persons they are in the position of a single tenant , i.e. each is regarded as being wholly entitled to the property.

## CHARACTERISTICS OF A JOINT TENANCY

The right of survivorship : On the death of one joint tenant his interest automatically passes to the surviving tenants.

The existence of the 4 Unities:

- -Unity of Possession : Possession of the land is vested in all the joint tenants, and none of them holds any part of it to the exclusion of the others.
- -Unity of Interest : The interest of each is the same in quantity; in practice, the rents and profits of the lands divided equally between the joint tenants and that there can be no joint tenancy between persons of different interest.
- -Unity of Title : All the joint tenants together constitute a single tenant and each derives his title from the same act or instrument.
- -Unity of Time : All the joint tenants acquired the land and the interest in it at the same time.

Common mode of co-ownership between married couples or close relatives. Neither of the 2 can dispose of their interest by will and on the death of either one, the survivor takes all.

Joint tenancy can be severed and converted to a tenancy-in-common by an instrument of declaration.

## UNIT 2.11: CO

## TERMINATION OF JOINT TENANCY

- -By alienation : which means by selling away one's share making the joint tenancy a sole ownership or tenancy-in-common. Eg. One of the co-owners need money, sells his share to his other joint tenant, such that the it's now owned by one owner, sole ownership.
- -By partitioning : means breaking the joint tenancy by way of mutual agreement. Sometimes husband and wife in order to prevent the other party from being implicated in a law suit, may partition the joint tenancy of their assets into tenancy-in-common so that the spouse can be spared the joint liabilities.
- -By partitioning via court order : eg in divorce where the court will instruct the divorced couple to dispose of the martial home and split the sale proceeds according to a certain apportionment by percentage. This effectively breaks up the joint tenancy into ownership by percentage shares.

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## TENANCY IN COMMON

Concurrent ownership of a property by 2 or more persons, each having a distinct but undivided share in the property.

Each is not regarded as being entitled to the whole property.

Situations in which a tenancy in common arises are:

- Where land is limited to two or more persons with " words of severance " i.e. words importing distinctness of interest showing intention to hold separate or equal shares in the land

- Where what is in strict legal terms a joint tenancy is treated in equity as though it was a tenancy in common e.g. where joint tenants of land have provided the purchase money in unequal shares, or where land is purchased by partners or where land is taken on mortgage by two or more mortgagees.

- Where the law provides, e g the common property of a strata-titled building is held by subsidiary proprietors as tenants in common

- Where one joint tenant alienates his interest to a stranger, e.g. by selling it, the stranger holds the interest as a tenant in common with the remaining joint tenants who, however, as among themselves, remain joint tenants.

## FORMS OF OWNERSHIP: SUMMARY

## Tenants-in-common

1. Shareholdings need not be equal
2. The rule of survivorship does not apply. The deceased owner's entitlement in the property passes to his estate.
3. Upon death of a co-owner, the property cannot be dealt with until the personal representative of the deceased co-owner has been appointed.
4. Where the shareholding is equal, the tenancy-in-common can be converted to a joint tenancy by registering a declaration in the prescribed form at the Singapore Land Registry.
5. Only 1 unity present, unity of possession

## Joint Tenants

1. Upon severance, each owner is presumed to have an equal share.
2. The rule of survivorship applies. Upon the death of an owner, the deceased owner's entitlement in the property passes to the survivor(s).
3. Upon death of a co-owner, the surviving coowner can deal with the property.
4. 4.The joint tenancy can be converted to a tenancy-in-common in equal shares by registering a declaration in the prescribed form at the Singapore Land Registry.
5. 4 unities must be present

## PARTNERSHIPS

A partnership is not a legal person and cannot hold property.  When the property is intended as partnership property, then the individual as legal owners hold the property in trust for themselves as partners.

## MENTAL CAPACITY ACT (MCA)

The Mental Capacity Act came into operation on 1 March 2010. The Office of Public Guardian (OPG), headed by the Public Guardian, is set up under the MCA to provide a range of functions that contribute towards the protection of persons who lack capacity.

The MCA allows individuals to voluntarily appoint one or more persons to decide and act on their behalf, if they were to lose their mental capacity someday. Through a legal instrument, the Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA), an individual may voluntarily appoint one or more trusted persons to decide and act on his behalf in two broad areas: personal welfare and/or property and affairs matters.

Even if the individual does not choose to elect a proxy decision maker in advance, applications can be made to t he Court to appoint a deputy to make decisions on an individual's behalf, when he loses his capacity. The MCA also enables parents of a child with intellectual disabilities to appoint a deputy to oversee the child's welfare and financial matters.

Under the Act, individuals who wish to make advance plans for themselves can do so through a new statutory document known as the Lasting Power of Attorney ('LPA'). In the LPA, the individual (donor) can appoint a proxy (donee) to act or make decisions on his behalf for matters relating to his personal welfare and/or property and finances.

The Act also sets out safeguards to protect these vulnerable members of our society.

## LASTING POWER OF ATTORNEY (LPA)

An LPA is a legal document which allows a person aged 21 years or older ('donor'), to voluntarily appoint one or more persons ('donee') he trusts, to decide and act on his behalf should he lose mental capacity.

An LPA takes effect when the donor loses mental capacity. A donee steps in only when the person has lost mental capacity.

The LPA allows for a person to plan for a possible future occurrence where he/she may lose his/her mental capacity.

There are two prescribed LPA forms. If the donor wishes to give his donee(s) powers to decide on all matters for him, he may use the LPA Form 1, which is available at OPG (Office of the Public Guardian) or which can be downloaded from www.publicguardian.gov.sg.  If the donor has more requirements to be included in his LPA, he should consult a lawyer to make the LPA, using LPA Form 2.

An independent certificate issuer is required to explain the terms of the LPA to every individual looking to make an LPA, and ensure that the individual understands what he/she is signing, and that he/she is doing it voluntarily and is not making the LPA under duress. The prescribed certificate issuers include practising lawyers, psychiatrists and accredited general practitioners.

There is a six-week mandatory waiting period before an LPA can be registered. Objections which can be raised during this waiting period include:

- -The donor made the LPA under duress.
- -The donor does not have the mental capacity to make the LPA.
- -The donor is a bankrupt and appoints a property and affairs donee.

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## DONEE(S)

Donees can be appointed in two broad areas, namely: personal welfare and/or property &amp; affairs matters. If there are more than one donees appointed, the donor can specify for them to act

- -Jointly: donees must always act together; or
- -Jointly and severally: donees can act together or separately

A donor may choose to appoint one or more donees for similar/different matters.  Any actions or decisions made by the donee on behalf of the donor must be made in the best interest of the donor.

The donee should be a family member or friend who is:

- -trustworthy;
- -reliable; and
- -competent to make decisions that you have authorised.

## TERMINATION OF DONEE'S POWERS OR REVOCATION OF LPA

An LPA and/or powers of the donee(s) can be revoked under certain circumstances:

- -The donor, while he still has mental capacity, decides to revoke the LPA;
- -Death of the donor or donee;
- -The donee loses mental capacity;
- -Bankruptcy of the donor or donee terminates any powers granted by the LPA in respect of property and affairs; and
- -Dissolution or annulment of the marriage between the donor and donee, unless the donor specified in the LPA that such an event will not cause the LPA to be revoked.

The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is Singapore's national land use planning authority.

URA takes a long term and integrated approach in land use planning to optimise the use of Singapore's limited land in meeting the current and future needs of the people.

URA works with relevant government agencies to develop broad planning strategies to guide long term planning, identify sufficient land for different needs and establish the broad pace of development. Infrastructure is then planned and developed to support the proposed land uses, and resources channelled to develop these areas over time.

## PLANNING PROCESS:

## CONCEPT PLAN

- -A strategic land use and transportation plan that guides Singapore's development over the next 40-50 years .
- -Reviewed every 10 years
- -Ensures that there is sufficient land to meet long-term population and economic growth needs while providing a good quality living environment for Singapore.
- -First Concept Plan was formulated in 1971 and subsequently reviewed in 1991 and in 2001 to factor in changes in local and global trends, and ensure that plans remain relevant to address future challenges and meet needs.
- -Most recent review was carried out in 2011.

In January 2013, the government released the Population White Paper which set out the key considerations and roadmap for Singapore's population policies and also projected Singapore's potential population by 2030. MND released the Land Use Plan to complement the Population White Paper. It outlines the strategies to support population and economic growth, while ensuring a high quality living environment for all Singaporeans.

The Land Use Plan is a conceptual plan that outlines the strategies to provide the physical capacity to sustain a high quality living environment for a possible population range of 6.5 to 6.9 million by 2030. It also sets aside land to provide options beyond 2030, so that future generations will have room for growth and opportunities.

Concept Plan

Master Plan

The strategies to sustain a high quality living environment include:

- -Providing good affordable homes with a full range of amenities
- -Integrating greenery into the living environment
- -Providing greater mobility with enhanced transport connectivity
- -Sustaining a vibrant economy with good jobs
- -Ensuring room for growth and a good living environment in future

The broad strategies and proposals set out in the Land Use Plan will be translated into detailed plans in the upcoming Master Plan review, which will guide Singapore's development over the next 10 to 15 years.

## MASTER PLAN

- -A statutory plan
- -Guides development over the next 10 to 15 years.
- -Translates the broad, long-term strategies of the Concept Plan into detailed plans for implementation by specifying the permissible land uses and densities.
- -Reviewed once every five years.
- -First introduced in 1958 and has undergone regular updates every 5 years.
- -Has evolved from being a plan which simply reflected preceding land use amendments to one which focuses on planning ahead for future developments. In particular, it was transformed to a more forward-looking planning document in the mid 1990s through the advent of the Development Guide Plans (DGPs), which set out detailed planning objectives at the local and regional levels that were aligned with the broader planning intentions of the Concept Plan.
- -Master Plan 2019 was gazetted on 27 th November 2019.

## PLANNING BOUNDARIES

## PLANNING REGIONS

URA divides Singapore into 5 regions:

- -Central
- -West
- -North
- -North-East
- -East

Each region has a population size of more than 500,000 people and provide a mix of residential, commercial, business and recreational areas. Each region will be served by a Regional Centre to complement the activities in the Central Business District.

## PLOT RATIO

Plot ratio is defined as the ratio of the gross floor area of a building(s) to its site area.

Plot ratio : Gross Floor Area / Site Area

Gross Floor Area : Total area of the covered floor space measured between the centre line of party walls, including the thickness of external walls but excluding voids. Accessibility and usability are not criteria for exclusion from GFA.

Net Lettable Area : NLA is the floor space between the internal finished surfaces of permanent internal walls and the internal finished surfaces of dominant portions of the permanent outer building walls. It generally includes window frames and structural columns and excludes toilets, cupboards, plant/motor rooms and tea rooms where they are provided as standard facilities in the building. It also excludes areas dedicated as public spaces or thoroughfares such as foyers, atrium and building service areas.

## VOID AREA

A Void Area refers to the empty space above the floor in a strata unit but the area is included in the total saleable floor area of the strata unit. It is usually found in a property with a very high ceiling. The detailed breakdown of a strata unit's floor area is available in the Sale and Purchase (S&amp;P) agreement. Some examples of Void Areas are void over staircase, or a double-volume living room within a maisonette.

For example developers construct a raised platform over the part of the unit with high ceiling height, and market as an increase of usable floor area, which is not allowed.

## BUILDING HEIGHT PLAN

Areas without special height controls are subject to prevailing development control guidelines. For example, residential development will follow the GPR / Storey Height Typology for flats and condominium as shown in Table. For other land uses without stipulated building height controls, the permissible height will be subject to evaluation.

Standard GPR/Storey Height Typology for Residential Developments:

| Gross Plot Ratio   | Storey Height Control   |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| 1.4                | 5                       |
| 1.6                | 12                      |
| 2.1                | 24                      |

## LANDED HOUSING AREAS PLAN

The Landed Housing Areas Plan is drawn up to help retain the character of landed housing estates. By safeguarding these estates, URA ensures a variety of housing mix, to meet the needs and aspirations of Singaporeans who want to live in landed housing.

The locations of these safeguarded estates, and the type of housing that can be built in each estate can be found on the Landed Housing Plan. These estates are categorised by the predominant housing form as follows:

## Good Class Bungalow area

- -bungalow development must have a minimum plot size of 1,400 sqm. Strata bungalows are also permitted.

## Bungalow area

- -bungalow development must have a minimum plot size of 400 sqm. Strata bungalows are also permitted.

## Semi-detached area

- -where bungalows, strata bungalows, semi-detached and strata semi-detached houses are permitted.

## Mixed Landed housing area

- -any form of landed housing such as bungalows, semi-detached houses and terrace type I (occupying a land area of 150 sqm) are permitted. In addition, townhouses, strata bungalows and cluster housing with their own control guidelines are also permitted. Terrace type II (occupying a land area of 80 sqm) is, however subject to evaluation as these houses with 1.0m front setback could affect the streetscape.

## MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING BUILDINGS

Existing buildings may remain until they are rebuilt in the future.

The proposal to rebuild the existing building is subject to evaluation based on the landed housing proposal for the area.

The following guidelines must be followed when renovating or modifying the existing house. In addition, the prevailing planning controls on plot size, plot width and building setback requirements must be satisfied. For bungalows, the proposed extensions must also satisfy the site coverage requirements.

## ENVELOPE CONTROL GUIDELINES FOR LANDED HOUSING

Envelope control guidelines guides the size and shape of the house in the redevelopment of landed houses.  It is effective from 11 May 2015. 12m

The guidelines simplify the existing guidelines and provide developers and homeowners more flexibility in the design of landed housing while safeguarding the low-rise character of landed housing estates.

2m

The new guidelines adopt a volumetric approach, where the allowable building massing of landed houses is guided by the permissible building envelope. The latter serves as a three-dimensional limit within which a landed house can be designed. It is determined by a combination of setbacks from the road and common plot boundaries, as well as the allowable height for the house. Figure 1 shows the envelope control for two and three-storey landed houses. They have an overall height of 12.0 m and 15.5 m for two and three-storey landed houses respectively, with the topmost floor being 3.5 m high and set back from the front and rear building facade as defined by the 45 degree line.

Within the building envelope, homeowners will now have flexibility to deviate from the existing planning guidelines to configure the interior space of their homes. The existing planning guidelines on the attic profile, basement protrusion, third storey setback and floor-to-floor height will no longer apply.    For instance, homeowners can now vary floor to ceiling height to have a mix of spacious and compact spaces. They can also design the attic without the sloping roof and the basement to have more protrusion above ground, which will let in more ventilation and light.

The envelope control guidelines are meant to guide only the main building.  Hence, landed houses will continue to be subject to existing guidelines on other building features and appendages such as car porches, roof eaves and reinforced concrete ledges.  In addition, the requirements of other agencies, especially those relating to construction standards and safety, will continue to apply.  As the envelope control guidelines are not intended to promote intensification, houses should continue to keep to the two-storey or three-storey height control applicable to the respective landed estates. This will continue to safeguard the character of our landed estates.

The envelope control guidelines is applicable to all landed houses island-wide. They will supersede the existing guidelines for proposals involving new erection or major reconstruction works to landed houses. However, minor Additions &amp; Alterations (A&amp;A) works to existing landed houses which were approved under the existing guidelines will continue to be evaluated under the existing guidelines.

## FLATS AND CONDOMINIUMS

## SHOEBOX UNITS

To ensure that there will not be an excessive development of shoebox units and to ensure that residential estates can be supported by local infrastructural capacities, URA implemented a guideline on the maximum number of dwelling units (DUs) for flat.

The dwelling unit (DU) cap stipulates the maximum number of DUs for all new flats   and condominium   developments outside the Central Area (CA), including the residential component of mixed-use developments, such as Residential with 1 st storey commercial or commercial &amp; residential developments and residential estates within GPR 1.4.

The DU Cap is based on the following formula:

Maximum number of DUs per development

## SMALL OFFICE HOME OFFICE (SOHO)

SOHO is a marketing term used by developers and estate agents. It does not refer to any specific use or type of development that is allowable or approved by the Competent Authority under the Planning Act.  The planning permission for a unit marketed as a SOHO unit is for either residential or office use but not for both uses.

Residential units are intended for long-term residential stay, and cannot be converted to other uses, like commercial uses, that could cause disturbances and inconveniences to residents. However, under the Home-Office Scheme, owners of residential units can use their homes to conduct smallscale businesses, provided they do not cause disamenity to other residents. To do so, the owner must register for the home-office use under the Home Office Scheme (see http://www.ura.gov.sg/uol/home-office/Register/Guidelines/about.aspx for details). Only smallscale businesses that comply with the planning guidelines applicable to home-offices (e.g. not hiring more than two non-resident employees) are permitted within residential units. Other commercial

businesses or uses that do not meet the guidelines are not allowed.

Office properties are to be used according to their approved use (i.e. as offices), and are not meant for residential use. Hence, the term 'SOHO' for office developments in any of advertisements should be refrained and should not make any representations to intending purchasers that the office units may be used for residential uses.

## HOME OFFICE SCHEME

Under the Home Office (HO) scheme, home owners, tenants or occupiers of private residential properties can conduct small -scale businesses in their homes, as long as they satisfy the prevailing HO guidelines and performance criteria and ensure that the use does not cause amenity problems to the neighbours.

## Registering for the Home Office Scheme

Anyone who is the owner, tenant or any authorised occupier of a private residential property and wish to operate a Home Office (HO) can register.

Written consent must be obtained from the owner before a tenant register for the Home Office use.

## Restrictions

Restrictions and performance criteria ensures the scale of the home office use is kept small so that it does not disturb or cause inconvenience to the neighbours.

## These include:

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

- not hiring more than 2 non-resident employees

- not displaying any external business signage or advertisements

- not generating noise, smoke, odour, waste matter or dust

- the use does not fall within the list of businesses that are not permitted under the HO scheme (e.g. car trading business, shops and any form of retail activity, etc)

## COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

## SHOEBOX RETAIL

With effect from 27 March 2013, average retail unit size should be at least 50 square metres (sqm), or the development's total net flo or area divided by the number of retail units at commercial or mixed-use developments.

In addition, corridors width must have minimum width of 2.0m -2.4m for corridors with only a row of retail units on one side (single loaded). For corridors with retail units on both sides (double loaded), the minimum width is between 2.4m and 3.0m.

## INDUSTRIAL B1 SPACE

URA zones land as B1 to support industrial activities so as ensure that land is kept affordable.

Offices and shops are not considered industrial use and are not allowed within industrial developments. These activities should be carried out on land zoned for commercial use.

URA requires at least 60% of the total floor area of an industrial development to be used for core industrial activities.

Supporting non-industrial uses, together with other ancillary areas (e.g. lift lobbies and circulation spaces) are allowed to occupy up to 40% of the total floor area of an industrial development.

## GUIDELINES FOR SUPPORT USES IN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT

## Industrial Canteens

Under previous guidelines, staff canteens within industrial developments were restricted to serving staff  working  within  the  same  building.  To  expand  the  range  of  food  options  within  industrial estates, URA will now allow such canteens to serve not only the workers of the same building but also external customers. These canteens which serve primarily workers in the industrial estate will now be termed as 'industrial canteens'.

## New industrial canteens will be:

- i. Capped  at  a  size  of  700  sqm  or  5%  of  the  total  proposed  Gross  Floor  Area  (GFA)  per development, whichever is lower;
- ii. Levied Industrial 'D' rates when computing Development Charge/Differential Premium; and
- iii. Approved on Temporary Permission (TP) for up to 3 years.

## CONSERVATION PROPERTIES

Historic buildings provide a valuable link to Singapore's heritage and conserving them is an important part of Singapore urban planning. There are over 7,000 buildings have been gazetted for conservation. They are located mainly in the city centre and around its fringes, and comprise largely shophouses and bungalows.

The 4 main categories area are:

- -Historic Districts : include Boat Quay, Chinatown, Kampong Glam and Little India, are among the city's oldest areas. Most of the buildings in these areas are stil l intact, and the entire building has to be retained and restored.
- -Residential Historic Districts : Blair Plan, Cairnhill and Emerald Hill. Rear extension lower than the main roof can be built for greater flexibility in adapting the building for modern living.
- -Secondary Settlements : Geylang and Joo Chiat areas. Emphasis is placed on retention of streetscape. A new rear extension up to the maximum height allowed for the area can be built.
- -Bungalows : Detached buildings with architectural styles.  For bungalows, the main house needs to be kept.

## SHOPHOUSE

- -narrow, small terraced houses, with a sheltered 'five foot' pedestrian way at the front.
- -can be used for both business and living.
- -constructed between the 1840s and the 1960s,
- -two- to three- storeys high, built in contiguous blocks with common party walls.
- -Form the bulk of our gazetted conservation buildings.
- -Need to follow URA's guidelines for restoration.

- -Payable when:
- -Change in use to a higher use
- -Change in zoning to a higher use zone , e.g. from a residential zoning to a commercial zoning
- -Increase in intensity of development , e.g. an increase in the plot ratio beyond what is permitted in the Master Plan 2003
- -A combination of both change in use and intensity resulting in a higher value .
- -Owner of the land or the applicant for the planning permission is liable for payment.
- -Development charge rates may vary.
- -IRAS and MND carry out a joint review of the rates every 6 months, in Mar and September of each year.
- -Latest information on the DC rates, use groups and sector maps can be obtained at http://www.ura.gov.sg/dc/Development%20Charge.htm.

The following forms of development or property projects are exempt from payment of Development Charge:

## CALCULATION OF DEVELOPMENT CHARGE

Development charge is payable when the development ceiling exceeds the development baseline, i.e.

Development Charge payable = Development Ceiling -Development Baseline

2 Basis of computing:

- 1) Fixed rate Development Charge
2. -Refers to a Fixed Rate Table containing rates for different land use groups in different geographical areas.
3. -118 geographical sectors, 10 use groups (2 for residential groups)
4. -If you are dissatisfied with the development charge determined by the fixed rate method, you may request the Competent Authority to determine the development charge on a case by case valuation of the land enhancement. However, this must be done within 14 days of the Interim Order being served on you.

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## 2) Case by case valuation

- -Once you have chosen the case by case basis to determine the development charge, you cannot revert to the fixed rate system. However, you may abort the first application for planning permission, and reapply for a new planning permission.
- -With effect from 18 July 2007, development charge is determined at 70% of the enhancement in value.

## DEVELOPMENT CEILING

Development ceiling is the value of the development proposed for a site and allowed by URA.

You can work out the development ceiling by using the following formula:

Development Ceiling = Proposed Gross Floor Area  X  DC rate for the use group in the Sector where the site is located

## DEVELOPMENT BASELINE

With effect from 1 Jan 2008, development baseline is defined in the Planning Act as the value derived from the use and intensity of the approved development on the land, for which development charge was paid, exempted, remitted or not required to be paid.

## EXAMPLE ON COMPUTATION OF DEVELOPMENT CHARGE

## USING FIXED RATE TABLE

Information

Land area: 2,000 sq m

Existing development: Residential (Use group B1), plot ratio 2

Proposed development: Retail commercial (Use group I), plot ratio 3

Geographical Sector: 27

Latest DC Table: Use Group B1: $2,100; Use Group I: $4,184

## Development ceiling

Proposed retail commercial development

Gross floor area (2000 x 3) @ $4,184

= $25,104,000

Less

Development baseline

Existing residential development

Gross floor area (2000 x 2) @ $2,100

= $8,400,000

Development Charge = $16,704,000

## Using Valuation Method

Residential Land worth $8,000,000

Rezoned to commercial development, valued at $28,000,000

Value of commercial land:
