## CHARACTERISTICS OF REAL ESTATE

Real estate has physical and economic characteristics, which makes it different from other commodity.

## PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

## -Indivisible

You cannot buy or sell one square metre of a property at a time.

## -Immobile

Once a property is built it is fixed to that location. You cannot move property from an area of low demand to an area of high demand.

## -Durable

Pure land is totally durable, and buildings and other capital improvements have a relatively long life compared to other goods. Once you develop a building it remains in existence for a significant period of time.

Over time, property deteriorate and investors must expect repair and refurbishment costs, or depreciation occurs in the value of their asset. The first type of depreciation refers to the deterioration of buildings over time as a result of wear and tear.  The second is obsolescence which is related to changes in market conditions, building technology and the functional requirements of the occupiers.

## -Heterogeneous

Each unit of property is unique. They vary by location, design, type, construction, size, use, tenant and lease terms.

## ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS

## -High transaction costs

Costs involved in selling/buying a property include legal costs, agent costs, stamp duty etc. The high cost of buying and selling property rights inhibits market participants from responding rapidly to changing conditions.

- -Illiquid

Takes time to buy and sell a property.  The time that it takes to realise the cash tied up in a property is significantly longer than the time it takes to sell equities.

- -Long transaction time

Takes at least 6 to 8 weeks for property transaction to be completed.

- -Supply is very inelastic (fixed) in the short run

It takes time to undertake development or redevelopment projects. In the long run, it is  more elastic but this is limited by the capacity of the construction industry and the supply of land.

-External costs and benefits associated with the use of land and property. Adjacent land uses may complement one another, thereby adding to the value of those properties. Alternatively, bad neighbour uses may reduce the value of some properties.

## -Intervention of the government

Extensive government control exists in the property market and these influence the demand and supply of property.

Eg: Introduction of Buyer's Stamp Duty, lifting up restriction of foreign property ownership

- -Irrational participants

Market participants do not always behave rationally or seek profit/utility maximisation. Status, symbolism and other non-financial benefits attached to property may result in some owners being unwilling to sell their property despite certainty of monetary gain.

- -Imperfect information

Information is not readily and completely available in the property market.

- -Costs in property management

There may be a need to management and administration which includes maintenance, rent collection, rent reviews and lease negotiations for properties.

## INVESTMENT

## RISK-RETURN TRADEOFF

Returns : Gain or loss made on investment.  May be in the form of income earned and/or capital gain or loss.

## REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (REITS)

REITs are investment schemes where there is aggregation of funds to invest in a portfolio of real estate assets, generating an income for the unit holders.

Real estate assets can range from commercial (offices), industrial properties, retail malls, hospitality assets such as hotels or serviced apartments.  These assets are professionally managed and income generated are normally distributed at regular intervals the unit holders.

Investment objectives for REITs are similar stocks investments which is income distribution and long term appreciation potential.

## CHARACTERISTICS OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (REITS)

## -Diversification

REITs may own various property portfolios with different tenants.  The risk of relying on a single property or tenant is reduced due to the pool of properties owned by the REIT.

Some REITs may have diverse range of assets in various countries.

## -Affordability

The is better opportunity as REITs have the advantage of having the pooled capital to acquire various properies  as compared to an individual investor.  REIT allows unit holders to invest in large assets based on what is affordable to them.

## -Liquidity

Unit holders can easily convert their assets to cash as compared to investing directly in real estate.  As REITS are listed on the stock exchange, it is easy to buy and sell a REIT as compared to a real estate asset.

## -Tax Benefits

Distribution of dividends are tax-exempt for REITs investors.

## -Transparency and flexibility

As REITS are traded on the stock exchange, the process of buying and selling a REIT is transparant and flexible.  Investors have access to REIT prices and can trade throughout the trading day.

In addition, there is corporate governance and transparency as REITS have to abide to applicable laws protecting the interests of the unit holders.

## SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF PROPERTIES

## MARKET /PRICE MECHANISM

## SUPPLY

Supply

: Amount a product is placed in the market , ie amount of property available in the market

Supply curve

: Relationship between price and quantity in the market at a specified time.

Slopes upwards

as quantity supplied will increase as price increases.

Supply comes from sellers and developers. At higher price, there will be more sellers in the market.

## Supply Curve

<!-- image -->

In the short run , supply is very inelastic as it takes times for buildings to be constructed. In the long run, the supply will be flatter.

## Factors affecting supply of real estate are:

- -Vacant development sites
- o Government's land sale programme
- o Supply can change by increasing intensity of land, eg higher plot ratio
- -Existing stock of buildings/houses
- o Fixed at any point in time
- -New buildings

Price

$1500 psf

## DEMAND

Supply Curve

MARKET PRICE

Demand: Amount a product that the market is willing to purchase

Demand curve : Relationship between price and quantity purchased in the market at a specified time. Slopes downwards as price decreases, more goods are being purchased.

Demand comes from buyers.  As price decreases, there will be more buyers.

## Demand Curve

<!-- image -->

## Factors affecting demand are:

- -Political
- o Political stability
- o Government policies such as the introduction of additional stamp duty, relaxation of HDB policies will affect the demand.
- -Social
- o Population sizes, demographic shifts, lifestyle and preferences/needs and tastes
- -Economic
- o Economic conditions, interest rates, employment rate, GDP, inflation

## INTERACTION BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND

The interaction between Demand and Supply determines price .

Price: where demand and supply curve meets

Seller's market: P rice increase when demand increases or supply decreases.

Buyer's market: Price decrease when demand decreases or supply increases.

## REAL ESTATE CYCLE

- -Real estate activities level fluctuate, and the change formed can be measured by the changes in price and volume of sales over time
- -The cycle, which is a wave like form is similar to the business cycle, influenced by economic events
- -Starting from a low turning point, the cycle expands as activity builds up till it reaches an upper turning point, followed by a decline into a period of recession.

## Real Estate Cycle

<!-- image -->

- -Expansion (boom or peak) -sustained growth in demand, increasing construction, speculators enter market, high consumption, liberal banks, and keen competition among the banks to court big spenders
- -Characterised by high transaction volume and high prices
- -Decline -positive but falling demand. Speculative developers enter the market, more properties are built and supply eventually exceeds demand. Banks start to restrict loans, interest rates gets higher, tighter credit supply ; increasing vacancy
- -Recession (bottom or trough) -falling demand, increasing vacancy, low rentals, high interest rates, buyers difficulty in servicing loans, results in mortgagee sale, may drag for a few years.
- -Recovery (Upswing) -Improvement in economy, confidence returns, interest rates lowered to encourage buyers to enter market, resulting in increasing demand, decreasing vacancy. Increased volume of activity and prices will move market into expansion again.
- -The intensity and length of each phase depends on the overall socio-economic climate.

## BUSINESS AND REAL ESTATE CYCLES

There have been many researches and papers on the relationship of business and real estate cycles.

Most studies conclude that there is some form of relationship, and real estate cycle is a composite of the business cycle.

As real estate plays major role in the economy, a rise in real estate prices can affect businesses.  The construction industry, regulatory and monetary policies by the government have significant roles in affecting the cycles. The theory that the major real estate cycles, accommodated by monetary inflation, have significantly contributed to the major depressions is consistent with the historical record.

Whereas the smaller and more frequent business cycles may be due to random shocks or non-realestate causes, the larger real estate cycles have exhibited similar patterns and, historically, have occurred in regular intervals.

- -Property types: Residential, Commercial, Industrial

## a) URA Private Residential Price Index

Besides an overall property price index for private residential properties, sub-indices for detached, semi-detached, terrace houses, apartments and condominiums are also compiled. HDB flats and other public sector buildings are excluded in the compilation of the property price index.

<!-- image -->

Central Region, East Region, North-East Region, North Region and West Region. Each Planning Region consists of several planning areas. As certain Planning Regions may have very few transactions of a certain type of property, not all the five Planning Regions will have a sub-index compiled for each type of property. For example, sub-indices for detached houses in the North and West Regions are not compiled as most of the transactions involving detached houses are concentrated in the Central, East and North-East Regions.

## Core Central Region

SUKIT

The Core Central Region is made up of postal districts 9, 10, 11, Downtown Core Planning Area and Sentosa. Rest of Central Region ESS EXPRESSW

## CONVERT 6 DIGIT POSTAL CODE TO OLD DISTRICT NUMBER

Singapore was originally divided into 28 postal districts in 1950, with a number being allocated to each district, for example, the Orchard Road area was in District 9.

On 1 September 1995, this was replaced by a six-digit system, in which every building was given its unique postcode, the first two digits of which represented the old sector, i.e. 23.

Although the old districts are no longer used by Singapore Post, they are still widely used to refer to locations of properties for sale or rent.

To ascertain the old postal district classification

- -Log on the SingPost to find the postal code
- -Take the first 2 digits of the 6-digit postal code and compare to the list below.

|   Postal District | Postal Sector (1st 2 digits of 6-digit postal codes)   | General Location                                    |

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## UNIT 1.3: BASIC LAND LAW CONCEPT: INTRODUCTION

## LEARNING OUTCOMES:

At the end of this unit, you should be able to:

- Distinguish real property from personal property, proprietary right from personal right, ownership (the largest form of proprietary interest) from lesser interests, and legal interest from equitable interest.

## LAND LAW

Land law deals with the rights to use, alienate or exclude others from land. (Wikipedia) In Singapore, land law applicable are derived from:

- -English common law and equity
- -Local legislations

## REAL PROPERTY

- -Real property is a legal term describing ownership of permanent &amp; immovable properties, which includes land and buildings , and anything affixed to the land .
- -Real property: immovable such as warehouses, factories, offices
- -Personal property: movable such as goods or chattels. E.g. cars, clothing, furniture
- -In law, a hereditament (from Lat. hereditare, to inherit, heres, heir) is any kind of property that can be inherited.
- -The 2 types of hereditaments are:
- -Corporeal hereditaments : tangible property, ie can see and touch, like a house.
- -Incorporeal hereditaments : intangible property, ie, neither seen nor handled, like an easement (right of one individual to use another's property)

## CLASSIFICATIONS OF RIGHTS

Proprietary Right: Rights in rem, enforceable against the world at large, and instead of following particular persons, follow particular things

Personal Right: Rights in personam, can be enforced against a limited number of specific persons, e.g. breach of contract or negligence

Distinction: Exigibility, 'against whom can the right be enforced?'

Property right: Must be definable, identifiable by third parties, capable in its nature of assumption by third parties and have some degree of permanence or stability

E.g.: Landlord grants a lease of his house to Tenant and then sells his house. The lease continues in existence despite the fact that there is a new Landlord. The lease is not simply a personal relationship between the original landlord and the original tenant but is also a proprietary interest in land. By contrast, the licence (permission to be on another's land) is purely personal. If the licensor sells his interest in the land, the new owner is not bound by the licence and can simply ignore it.

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## INTERESTS IN LAND

Property interest refers to the extent of a person's or entity's rights in property .

It deals with the percentage of ownership, time period of ownership, right of survivorship, and rights to transfer.

## LEGAL INTEREST

- A right in or over land.

- Binds the whole world and all 3 rd parties.

## EQUITABLE INTEREST

- Only good against certain people and is defeated by the Bona Fide Purchaser for value without notice (Equity's D ealing)

- Equity's D ealing must:

- Be genuine and honest (bona fide)

- A buyer (purchaser)

- Give consideration (for value)

- Not have any notice of the equitable rights, be it actual, implied or constructive notice.

- Arises in property where it would be against conscience to allow the legal owner of property to keep the benefit of the property for himself.

- E.g: trusts, vendor-purchaser and mortgage relationships, restrictive covenants

## LEARNING OUTCOME:

At the end of this unit, you should be able to:

- Infer the legal meaning of land.
- Understand the legal definition of fixture and the two tests of determining whether a chattel is/has become a fixture, and ascentain whom (buyer or seller, landlord or tenant) a fixture belongs. Understand the common usage of the term 'fitting' by the indu stry and how it relates to 'fixture'.
- Identify the legal description of land lot, strata lot and accessory lot, and the documents from which to obtain such information.

## LAND

Land Titles Act define 'land' as

- -the surface of any defined parcel of the earth , all substances thereunder and so much of the column of airspace above the surface whether or not held apart from the surface as is reasonably necessary for the proprietor's use and enjoyment, and includes any estate or interest therein and all vegetation growing thereon and structures affixed thereto; or
- -any parcel of airspace or any subterranean space whether or not held apart from the surface of the earth and described with certainty by reference to a plan approved by the Chief Surveyor and filed with the Authority, and includes any estate or interest therein and all vegetation growing thereon and structures affixed thereto,

and where the context so permits, the proprietorship of land includes natural rights to air, light, water and support and the right of access to any highway on which the land abuts.

## Includes:

- -Surface, i.e. the soil
- -Airspace
- -Interest or estate in the land
- -Vegetation growing
- -Structures affixed
- -Natural rights to air, light and access to road

## FIXTURES &amp; FITTINGS

Chattels : an item of personal property which is movable , as distinguished from real property.

## FIXTURES

If a piece of equipment (chattels) which has been attached to real estate in such a way as to be part of the premises and its removal would do harm to the building or land, then it becomes a fixture .

## In essence:

- -A fixture is transformed from a movable asset to an integral part of the real property
- -Fixtures possess the attributes of both real and personal property.
- -If a chattel becomes a fixture, the ownership will be transferred to the new owner if there is a sale of the real property, even if it is not part of the contract.

## Fixture Test

2 tests are usually performed to determine whether a chattel has indeed become a fixture.

## 1. Degree of annexation of the chattel on the land

The degree of annexation test says that the chattel does not become part of the land unless it is connected to the land or building in a substantial way.

Assumptions made when determining the degree:

- -An item is presumed not to be a fixture if it is resting on its own weight and the person who asserts that it is a fixture, is obliged to prove it
- -An item is presumed to be a fixture if it is attached to the land to any extent and the person who asserts that it is not a fixture, is obliged to prove it.

## 2. Purpose of annexation

If the chattel has been fixed to the land with the intention (purpose of annexation) of permanently improving the land, then it can be presumed to be a fixture.

Consider if item is for its own enjoyment (eg television) or whether it will improve the convenience and use of the land.

Examples of fixtures: Toilet bowls, swimming pool, pond, lifts, grille gates etc

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## FITTINGS

Considered a personal property because it is not permanently attached to the land, hence is not a real property and will not be passed down to the successor.

Fittings or chattels personal are movable tangible articles, e.g. carpets, curtains, household goods, etc.

When IRAS calculates the annual value of the property to determine the property tax payable, the "rent" for fixtures is not allowed as deduction whereas the "rent" for the fittings is allowed to be deducted.

## THE RIGHT TO FIXTURES AS BETWEEN LANDLORD AND TENANT

The  general rule is that a chattel always remains the tenant's and is removable by him at the end of the tenancy, whereas a fixture is the property of the landlord and the tenant has no right of removal .

Exceptions to the general rule exist and fixtures have become classified as:

- -Landlord's fixtures : Those let as part of the premises at the start of the term, and any other put up by the tenant of which he has no right of removal.
- -Tenant's fixtures : Those which the tenant is entitled to remove, either through contract or law.

## Includes:

- -Trade fixtures: These are attached to the land for the purpose of carrying on a particular trade. However, these are not removable if to do so would necessitate the destruction of the building to which they are affixed. Eg, liquor bars, display shelves, booths, counters etc.
- -Ornamental fixtures: installed for convenience or ornament, provided that they can be removed without seriously damaging the land. Eg, stoves, shelves.
- -Agricultural fixtures: installed for the purpose of farming

## LEGAL DESCRIPTION OF LAND

Each land parcel in Singapore is uniquely identified by a lot number.

Identifier has 2 components, namely the survey districts Mukim (MK) or Town Subdivision (TS) number and the lot number.

For administrative purposes, Singapore is divided into 30 TS (TS1 to TS30) and 34 MK (MK1 to MK34).

TS are located around the city area whereas MK are found in the rural districts since mukim is the Malay word for rural area. The TS and MK boundaries may be altered by the Chief Surveyor.

SLA issues lot numbers to identify land parcels, more commonly called land lots, within a TS or MK. Meanwhile, strata lot numbers are assigned to units in a building when a building is subdivided.

## LOT BASE SYSTEM

The Lot Base System (LBS) maintains a complete inventory of all lot numbers in Singapore. It records the history of lot creation, amalgamation and subdivision of all lots in Singapore.

## When are new lot numbers allocated?

New land lot numbers are allocated when:

- -part of an existing lot is alienated or acquired by the Collector of Land Revenue; or
- -there is a request, with the relevant approval or authorisation to amalgamate and/or subdivide the land; or
- -new land parcels are formed arising from reclaimed land, allocation of new foreshore lot, airspace lot or subterrenean lot.

For Strata lots, new lot numbers are allocated when there is a request, with the relevant approval, to:

- -subdivide a building; or
- -amalgamate and/or subdivide an existing strata lot.

## LAND LOT

SLA issues lot numbers to identify land parcels, more commonly called land lots, within a TS or MK. Lot number alone cannot uniquely identify a lot as lots in different TS or MK may have the same lot number.

A lot also cannot sit on more than one TS or MK.

If a lot created by an amalgamation of parent lots crosses TS or MK boundaries, SLA will redefine such boundaries so that the new lot is wholly contained within one single TS or MK.

A lot can be subdivided into 2 or more lots, while two or more lots can be amalgamated into 1.

A land lot is the unit of land ownership. It can be owned by one owner or multiple owners as joint tenants or tenants-in-common with undivided portions.

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

Airspace and subterranean lots are 3-dimensional lots which are designated above and below the ground surface respectively. Airspace lot numbers start with the 70,000 series, and subterranean lot numbers start with the 80,000 series.

## STRATA LOT

Strata lot numbers are assigned to units in a building when a building is subdivided.

They bear the prefix "U" e.g. U12345X.

A strata lot can be further subdivided into 2 or more strata lots, and 2 or more strata units can be amalgamated into 1.

A provisional lot is a strata lot in 2 phased development where the future building shall be subdivided when it is built. Being a strata lot, it also bears the prefix "U".

An accessory lot is a strata lot which is made appurtenant to another strata lot. It bears the prefix "A" e.g. A22X

## LOT NUMBERING SYSTEM

The format for the land, strata and accessory lot numbers is designed to provide a simplified and uniform lot numbering system.

Lot numbers are allotted uniquely in a running series within each survey district and suffixed with a check alphabet.

Check alphabet is computer-generated and serves as a check against misquotes.

Please see the table below for a description of the lot number format where N ( ) is numeric and A ( ) is alphabetical:

| Type of lot number   | TS or MK   | TS or MK number   | Prefix   | Lot no.   | Check Alphabet   | Range                 |
|----------------------|------------|-------------------|----------|-----------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Land lot no.         | A(2)       | N(2)              | -        | N(5)      | A(1)             | 1-69999 &90000- 99999 |
| Airspace lot no.     | A(2)       | N(2)              | -        | N(5)      | A(1)             | 70000-79999           |
| Subterranean lot no. | A(2)       | N(2)              | -        | N(5)      | A(1)             | 80000-89999           |
| Strata lot no.       | A(2)       | N(2)              | U        | N(6)      | A(1)             | U1-U999999            |
| Accessory lot no.    | A(2)       | N(2)              | A        | N(4)      | A(1)             | A1-A9999              |

## INTEGRATED LAND INFORMATION SYSTEM (INLIS)

Integrated Land Information Service (INLIS) provides Land Titles searches where one can obtain map and /or textual land information.

Information obtained from INLIS:

- -Property Title Information
- -Propery Ownership Infomration
- -Land Information on Lot Particulars and Lot History
- -Caveat Index Information
- -Historical information
- -Images of Instruments
- -Images of Index to Land Books, Index to Caveat Books and Deeds

## SURVEY MAPS

After a lot number is assigned to a parcel of land or a property, a cadastral survey of the land is carried out to obtain an accurate measurement of the boundaries of the real property. The survey is required for or in connection with the registration of any title to the land or a property.

SLA maintains maps and plans in electronic form. These records include

- -Cadastral maps
- -Registrar of Title Plans (RT)
- -Certified Plans (CP) and Strata Certified Plans (CPST).

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## CADASTRAL MAPS

Cadastral Maps are survey maps prepared and maintained under the Boundaries and Survey Maps Act. To-date, there are 1,596 maps covering the whole of Singapore.

The data items shown in the maps are land lot numbers, house numbers, areas, lot boundaries, land tenures, title boundaries, survey plan numbers, survey district numbers and their boundaries, and road names.

The Cadastral Maps are updated as soon as the survey plans showing the subdivision or amalgamation of land parcels have been approved by the Chief Surveyor. New Cadastral Maps are created to accommodate newly reclaimed lands.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES:

At the end of this unit, you should be able to:

- Understand tenure and estate, and the various types of freehold and leasehold estates.

## TENURE AND ESTATE IN LAND

Estate: Duration of ownership

Tenure: Conditions and terms of ownership

2 types of land tenure:

- Freehold

- -Leasehold

## FREEHOLD LAND

In order to be categorized as a freehold, an estate must possess the characteristics of

- -Immobility -land/property
- -indeterminate duration -holds land 'forever' (unless the Singapore Government overrides it by compulsorily acquiring it)

A freehold title allows the owner to own the land forever .

2 categories of Freehold Property exists:

- i. Estate in Fee Simple
2. -Also known as Grant in Fee Simple
3. -Issued by the State
4. -Greatest possible estate in land, wherein the owner has the right to use it.  A fee simple represents absolute ownership of land, and therefore the owner may do whatever he or she chooses with the land. If an owner of a fee simple dies intestate, the land will descend to the heirs .
5. -Property Tax is the only expense annually payable by all property owners.  No further payments compared to Statutory Land Grant (SLG).
- ii. Estate in Perpetuity
7. -Also known as Statutory Land Grant (SLG)
8. -Freehold title issued by the State, subject to conditions in State Lands Act

## UNIT 1.5: ESTATES IN LAND

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## LEASEHOLD LAND

Duration of ownership is defined.

Government Land Sales (GLS) for residential are ALL 99 years leasehold

- Eg HDB land

- URA for condos and apartments

Private leases (not from government) possible at 999 or 9999 year lease.

## Other leases:

- JTC/HDB: 60/30 years

- MUIS properties: 199-year lease

## LAND TITLES (STRATA) ACT

- Provides for the vertical subdivision of land into lots and common property

- Each lot is issued with a different title

## TYPES OF STRATA-TITLED PROPERTIES

Strata titles are conferred upon:

- condominium;

- residential flats;

- townhouse;

- cluster housing;

- strata-bungalow;

- flatted factories;

- -Registrar will rely on the share value stated in the Schedule of Entitlement to issue the SSCTs.
- -Strata title plan will be deemed registered upon the registration of the Strata Title Application.
- -Register will assign a number to the strata title plan which forms the name of the management corporation

## SUBSIDIARY STRATA CERTIFICATE OF TITLE

Subsidiary Strata Certificates of Title are issued for units in a building or development which is strata subdivided. This enables the transfer of the legal titles for the strata units.

## When to apply

- -When a development with 3 or more strata units is completed up to roof level and strata subdivision approval has been granted by Chief Planner, URA.
- -When subdivision approval for a strata lot is granted by Chief Planner, URA e.g. when an office strata lot is subdivided to form 2 new office strata lots.
- -When planning permission is granted by Chief Planner, URA for amalgamation of strata lots e.g. when 2 existing office strata lots are amalgamated as one large strata lot.
- -When owners of flats built before the operation of the Land Titles (Strata) Act with leases registered under the Registration of Deeds Act or Land Titles Act apply to convert their leases to strata titles.

## STATE COVENANTS

- -restrictive covenant that CANNOT be removed by court order
- -eg: zoning, plot ratio, height restriction, setbacks, leasehold 99-year
- -CAN be removed only by paying Differential Premium (DP).

## DIFFERENTIAL PREMIUM

State lands are sold at a price based on the proposed use and intensity at the time of sale. The use and intensity are stipulated as conditions in the State title.

Differential Premium (DP): Charged for lifting the title restriction.

DP is the difference in value between the use and/or intensity stated in the State title and the approved use and/or intensity in the provisional planning permission.

DP is computed based on the Development Charge (DC) Table of Rates. The material date of determination of DP is pegged to the date of Provisional Permission (PP) or the start date of the validity of the second and subsequent PP extensions. Where the tenure of the land is leasehold, the DC rates will be adjusted to reflect the remaining tenure of the land using the Leasehold Table. However, in suitable cases where the State Title contains special restrictions, the DP payable may be determined using other methods and the resultant amount could be higher than the rate determined by the DC table.

Where the use stipulated in the title restriction does not fit into any of the Use Groups in the DC Table, the DP payable will be determined by the Chief Valuer on a case-by-case basis.

For more information on how to calculate DP, please refer to Appendix: The Differential Premium System and Changes to Differential Premium system on 18 July 2007.

## EXEMPTION FROM DEVELOPMENT CHARGE IF DIFFERENTIAL PREMIUM IS PAID

Lessees, with State leases that do not specify the use and/or the maximum allowable intensity for the land, are liable to pay Development Charge in respect of the enhancement in land value arising from a development proposal. With effect from 1 Sep 2011, subject to certain terms and conditions being satisfied, a lessee may be exempted from paying Development Charge if Differential Premium is paid for the enhancement in land value.

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## TEMPORARY OCCUPATION LICENCE (TOL)

SLA rents out vacant State lands through Temporary Occupation Licenses (TOLs).

- -Examples of uses under renewable TOL are worksite, signage, showflat, landscaping, etc .

Where the use of State land is for a one-off event and for a fixed duration of not more than 3 months, a Non-Renewable Temporary Occupation License (NRTOL) will be issued instead.

- -Examples of uses under NRTOL are tradefair, pasar malam, religious event, wayang, funeral wake, sale/entertainment event, etc.

Common Exam for House agents REHA)

## LAND ACQUISITION ACT

## GOVERNMENT'S RIGHTS TO ACQUIRE PROPERTY COMPULSORILY

Private property owners hold their land subject to the ability of the State to compulsorily acquire it for public purposes. Compulsory acquisition of private land by the State in Singapore is governed by the Land Acquisition Act.

Land in Singapore can be acquired for:

- -for any public purpose;
- -by any person, corporation or statutory board, for any work or an undertaking which, in the opinion of the Minister, is of public benefit or of public utility or in the public interest; or
- -for any residential, commercial or industrial purposes

## VALUATION BASIS FOR COMPENSATION

On 7 May 2007, the Land Acquisition Act (LAA) was amended to pay market value compensation for land acquired.

This Act amends the Land Acquisition Act to abolish the use of a statutory date in determining the basic compensation for land that is compulsorily acquired on or after 12 February 2007 and to provide that the basic compensation will instead be the market value of the land as at the date of its acquisition.

However, the market value of the acquired land cannot exceed the price which a bona fide purchaser might reasonably be willing to pay for the land.

The market value of the land is to be arrived having regard (but not only) to the zoning and density requirements and any other restrictions imposed by or under the Planning Act at the date of acquisition, and any restrictive covenants in the title of the acquired land. However, no account is to be taken of any potential value of the land for any other use more intensive than what is permissible by or under the Planning Act as at the date of its acquisition.

The Land Acquisition Act is also amended so that when accessing the market value of acquired land, it will no longer be prohibited to take into account any increase in value arising from any improvement to the land within 2 years before the date the land is declared to be required for a public purpose, or from development in the neighbourhood by the provision of roads, drains, electricity, water, gas or sewerage or social, education or recreational facilities within 7 years preceding that date.

The special compensation provisions for acquired land which is used as a burial ground and acquired land that is devastated or affected, directly or indirectly, by fire, explosion, thunderbolt, earthquake, storm, tempest, flood or any act of God, have also been abolished. Such land, if acquired, will be assessed no differently from other acquired land.

The compensation for land acquired before 12 February 2007 continues to be governed by the existing law.

## UNIT 1.7: RIGHTS IN ANOTHER'S LAND

## LEARNING OUTCOMES:

At the end of this unit, you should be able to:

- Explain the term 'encumbrances' on land title.
- Explain the nature of a licence.
- Distinguish a licence from a lease.
- Explain the nature and characteristics of an easement.
- Understand how an easement may be acquired and extinguished at common law, and under the Land Titles Act (LTA) and Land Titles (Strata) Act (LTSA).
- Explain the easements implied under LTA and LTSA.
- Understand the extent to which covenants affecting adjacent land owners bind their respective successors in title.
- Ascertain the existence of a restrictive covenant in a land title.
- Explain how a restrictive covenant may be discharged at common law and under the Land Titles Act.

## EMCUMBRANCES

Encumbrance: A right to, interest in, or legal liability on real property that does not prohibit passing title to the property but may diminish its value

Can be in the form of: lien, mortgage, easements, unpaid property tax

## LICENCE

A license may be granted by a party ("licensor") to another party ("licensee") as an agreement between those parties

A licence does no t give licensee a property right ; it simply allows licensee to act in a way that would otherwise interfere with licensor's property right.

Licensee will not have any legal interest in the property.

## 4 TYPES OF LICENCES:

- -Bare licences : permission to enter land. eg, if I invite you to dinner, this removes your duty not to enter my land.  However, I am free to change my mind and revoke the licence.
- -Contractual licences : Licence for specified period cannot be revoked until contractual period has expired
- o Granted by contract (valuable consideration)
- o Short term licences:
- Entry to cinema, football match, car park.
- o Long term licences:
- Occupy house/flat/shop
- -Estoppel licences :

What is an 'estoppel'?

'Equity…prevent a person insisting on his strict legal rights…when it would be inequitable for him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties.'

Eg: if the licensee was informally promised certain interest provided he spends significant amount of money to enhance the land, then the licensor (strict legal right) may be 'estopped' from stopping the licensee from using the land.

- -Licences coupled with a grant : permission to enter the land to carry out approved activities, usually for a profit.

Eg: A licence to go on land to sever and remove trees, are accepted examples of a licence coupled with an interest.

Land that benefits from an easement on another property. The other property, which usually is adjacent, is the servient tenement.Example: In Figure below the owner of Parcel A has a right-of-

way easement to the road by going across Parcel B.

Right-of-way

## EASEMENT

Raza

Easement: An easement is a certain right to use the real property of another without possessing it.

Easements require the existence of at least two parties . The party gaining the benefit of the easement is the dominant tenement -'A', while the party granting the burden is the servient tenement -'B'.

A good example would the 'Right of Way' displayed by diagram -A's (receiving benefits) users can only access to his land by passing through B's (suffering the burden) land.

<!-- image -->

Easement appurtenant is one that benefits the dominant estate and "runs with the land", i.e., an easement appurtenant generally transfers automatically when the dominant estate is transferred.

## AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE EASEMENTS

Affirmative easement : Right to use another's property (servient) for a specific purpose, while a negative easement is the right to prevent another from performing an activity on their property.

Eg, an affirmative easement might allow land owner A to walk/drive over the land of B to go home. A has an affirmative easement from B.

Negative easement might restrict B from blocking A's sea view by putting up a wall of trees. A has a negative easement from B

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF AN EASEMENT

- -There must be a dominant (A) and a servient (B) tenement;
- -The easement must provide the dominant tenement with benefits and enjoyment;
- -The dominant and servient owners must be different persons ;
- -The 'easement right' claimed must be capable of forming the subject-matter of a grant, eg you can define the right of way for A over B's land.

## CREATION OF EASEMENTS

Easements are most often created by express language in binding documents.  Parties generally grant an easement to another, or reserve an easement for themselves.

There are a few ways that easements are created:

- -Express easement : An express easement is created by a deed or by a will (must be in writing). An express easement can also be created when the owner of a certain piece of property conveys the land to another, but saves or reserves an easement in it. This arrangement is known as an "easement by reservation."
- -Implied Easements :  Even when no document or agreement has created an express easement, an easement right may still be implied (understood) in certain situations or circumstances.

Eg PUB takes care of the sewerage &amp; sanitary works in Singapore, thus, it has implied easement to enter a private property to perform its function of maintenance &amp; repairs.

## -By necessity :

E.g. An easement by necessity can only be created when land held by a single owner is severed into two or more parcels.

After severance, if any of the newly created parcels (parcel 'B') is physically unable to reach a public road, an easement by necessity may be created.

<!-- image -->

Easements by necessity are eith er granted to a buyer of a landlocked parcel ('B' in diagram), or reserved by a seller of land who retains a landlocked parcel ('B') after the severance and sale.

- -Easement by prescription: A right to use property, acquired by a long tradition of open and obvious use.

For example, if hikers have been using a trail through your backyard for ten years and you've never complained, they have an easement by prescription through your yard to the trail.

## TERMINATION OF EASEMENTS

A party claiming termination should show one or more of the following factors:

- -Release : agreement to terminate by the grantor and the grantee of the easement
- -Merger : When one owner gains title to both dominant and servient tenement
- -Necessity : If the easement was created by necessity and the necessity no longer exists
- -Prescription : The servient estate reclaims the easement with actual, open, hostile and continuous use of the easement
- -Abandonment : This is usually claimed where the easement has not been used or enjoyed for a significant length of time.  Under the Land Titles Act, an easement can be removed if the period exceeds 12 years of non-usage.

## COVENANT

A covenant is a type of contract in which the covenantor makes a promise to a covenantee to do or not do some action.

## POSITIVE COVENANTS

A covenant to do or perform something. Does not automatically 'run with the land' unless:

- -'Touch and concern' the land relate to interest in land
- -Privity of estate - the relation that subsists between a landlord and his tenant (eg sale with tenancy means the new buyer covenants to fulfill the Tenancy)

Useful tools to enforce obligations between landowners (e.g. a contribution towards the upkeep of common facilities).

## RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS

- -Restrain/restrict from doing something.
- -It 'runs with the land', ie subsequent buyers assume the 'burden' if it 'touch and concern' the land.
- -May prevent a landowner from using the land for a particular use (e.g. prohibit the sale of alcohol) or may restrict development (e.g. no building without consent).
- -Eg  HDB/URA/Conservation of Trees
- -Can be either:
- -Implied by law (planning policies) -eg MCST by-laws in strata buildings; or
- -Private agreement -restrict the height of trees so it does not block the neighbour's view of the reservoir.
- -The Land Titles Act provides for restrictions to expire 20 years from the date of creation/entry of a notification thereof on the land register.

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

- -Removed by:
- -release wholly or in part by notification of registered owner of dominant land and person having a registered interest in the land;
- -expiry term of restrictive covenants; and
- -by extinguishment or variation by order of court.

## RESTRICTIONS UNDER THE LAND TITLES ACT

Duration: Restrictions shall cease to be enforceable against assigns of the servient land at the expiry of 20 years from the date of entry of a notification thereof on the land-register.

Where a restriction was created before bringing the servient land under the provisions of this Act and the owner of the servient land is not the covenantor, the restriction shall (unless extended in the manner provided by this section) cease to be enforceable against the owner or assigns of the servient land at:

- -the expiry of 20 years from the date of creation of the restriction;
- -the expiry of 5 years from the date of entry of a notification thereof on the land-register; or
- -the expiry of 24 months from 20th August 2001 * ,

whichever expires the latest.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES:

At the end of this unit, you should be able to:

- Associate a property type with a property title: certificate of title, subsidiary strata certificate of title, or lease title.
- Interpret dealings that are notified in the title document, e.g. transfers, mortgages, charges, and leases exceeding 7 years.
- Understand the effect of registration and the priority of registered interests.
- Understand the function of a caveat and the period of its effectiveness.

## LAND REGISTRATION SYSTEM

Land Titles Registry, which comes under the SLA umbrella, handles the registration of property transactions in Singapore .

The Registry registers all legal transactions affecting land, including

- -landed property (bungalows, terrace houses and semi-detached houses)
- -flats (whether private or HDB) and
- -commercial and industrial properties.

Land register shows who owns the land and whether there are encumbrances, such as mortgages or charge affecting the land.

- -Protects the rights of property owners
- -Prevent fraudulent or secret transactions . Enables those purchasing, financing or otherwise dealing in land to conduct their transactions and business affairs efficiently and with certainty
- -Facilitate transactions by giving proof of title
- -Allows public searches to be conducted

## TYPES OF REGISTRATION

2 Systems for registration of property rights in Singapore

- i. The Register of Deeds for Common Law land under the Registration of Deeds Act; (OLD SYSTEM) and
- ii. The Land Titles Register for titles land under the Land Titles Act (Current System)

## UNIT 1.8: REGISTRATION OF TITLES

## REGISTRATION OF DEEDS ACT (RODA)

- -Title Deeds administered by the Registry of Deeds
- -In use since colonial times
- -Registrable instruments must be registered with the Registry of Deeds -registrable instruments includes conveyance, charge order of court, probate and letters of administration
- -Cumbersome as title has to be deduced for 15 years to 'good root of title'
- -Legal interests in land pass by deed, i.e. a document signed, sealed and delivered.
- -Under the Act, not compulsory for owners of land to register the deeds at the Registry of Deeds.
- -To verify the ownership of the land, a 15-year title search at the Singapore Land Registry must be made.
- -Difficult and time consuming.
- -Deed : document that transfers ownership of real estate. It contains the names of the old and new owners and a legal description of the property, and is signed by the person transferring the property

## REGISTER OF DEEDS

- -Record of deeds lodged against land held under the old Common Law system of land registration.
- -Presently there are hardly any deeds lodged at the Registry of Deeds.

## What can be registered?

- -Conveyance
- -Mortgage
- -Lease or agreement of lease exceeding 7 years
- -Memorandum of lien, charge or discharge. (Where an equitable mortgage created by a deposit of title deeds is accompanied by a memorandum, the memorandum is registrable);
- -Deed of consent to the discharge of a trustee;
- -Order of court (i.e. any judgement, decree, writ of execution or sequestration, adjustication in bankruptcy)
- -Certificate of appointment of trustee in bankruptcy
- -Grant of probate or letters of administration

Any document which does not come within the definition of a deed or assurance cannot be registered.

A person who has a non-registrable instrument, e.g. an agreement for sale, may want to protect his interest. He can do this by lodging a caveat with the SLR.

## ADVANTAGES FOR REGISTRATION

- a) Evidence

A registered document can be used as evidence of title.

- b) Secure priority

Registered documents have priority according to their dates of registration.

## TORRENS TITLE SYSTEM (LAND TITLES ACT AND LAND TITLES (STRATA) ACT)

- -Introduced in 1960.
- -Registration of title was modelled on the Torrens system of title registration in Australia.
- -Introduced under Land Titles Act, and extended to Strata Titles under Land Titles (Strata) Act
- -Simplify form of titles by using standardised forms in place of deeds
- -Facilitate transactions and results in lower registration costs
- -Single document of proof of title (Certificate of Title)
- -Contain all notifications of any dealings over land, therefore need not trace back 15 years.
- -A Land Titles Register is maintained
- -Registration is mandatory to effect the transfer of an estate or interest in land
- -Indefeasible Title: Title is guaranteed by the State
- -Register through STARS eLodgement.
- -Some interests that need not be registered such as short-term tenancies &amp; statutory easements are not reflected in the Certificate of Title.
- -Most of the old titles under the common law system have been converted to Torrens system.

## THREE PRINCIPLES OF TORRENS SYSTEM

The Torrens system works on three principle:

- -Mirror principle -the register (Certificate of Title) reflects (mirrors) accurately and completely the current facts about a person's title.
- -Curtain principle -one does not need to go behind the Certificate of Title as it contains all the information about the title. All of the necessary information regarding ownership is on the Certificate of Title.
- -Insurance principle -Assurance Fund provides for compensation of loss if there are errors made by the Registrar of Titles

Real Centre Network Pte Ltd

## THE LAND REGISTER

Land register is the authoritative record on the ownership of all properties registered under the Act in Singapore.

The Land-register provides information on:

- -Whether it is freehold or leasehold or others
- -Land area of the property
- -The name(s) of the registered owners
- -The legal arrangement by which the registered owners own the property (eg. Joint tenants or Tenants in common)
- -The addresses for service of legal notices on the registered owners
- -Whether there are legal interests (eg. Mortgages, CPF Charge) affecting the property

## CERTIFICATE OF TITLE (CT)

Whenever the State issues a State title, the Registrar of Titles will issue a Certificate of Title for that piece of land.

New Certificates of Title are issued when land is subdivided or amalgamated. This facilitates the transfer of the legal titles relating to landed properties

## QUALIFIED TITLES

- -One which has a caution endorsed on it, stating that the title is subject to the pre-existing claims or encumbrances.
- -Means that State does not guarantee the title and buyer must investigate the pre-existing common law deeds
- -Only when caution lapses that the title becomes indefeasible.
- -Caution automatically lapse after 10 years after land is converted, or after 2 years from the commencement of the amendment of the Land Title Act in 2001, even if there has been a sale after title conversion
- -This will completely eliminate the number of qualified titles, as it is now more than 10 years from the amendment in 2001.

## CAVEATS

- -Legal document lodged at SLA by any person (caveator) against a  claiming an interest in land against a property in which the caveator claims an interest

- -the lot affected by the caveat and, where that lot is comprised in a folio, the  folio;
- -where the caveat relates to only part of the land, such description of that part as will enable it to be identified to the satisfaction of the Registrar;
- -if the caveator is a purchaser or sub-purchaser of the interest in the land, the amount of the purchase price and the date of the caveator's contract or the date on which he exercised the option to purchase the interest in the land, as the case may be; and
