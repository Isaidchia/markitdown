## OVERVIEW

## INTRODUCTION

All real estate salespersons who carry out estate agency work in the sale or leasing transactions of residential (HDB and private housing), commercial and industrial properties must be registered with the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA). CEA is the regulatory body for the real estate agency industry and administers the Estate Agents Act 2010 and Regulations.

Prior to applying for registration as a salesperson, one must pass the Real Estate Salesperson (RES) Examination, which is one of the registration criteria stipulated under the Estate Agents (Licensing and Registration) Regulations 2010. The RES Examination consists of two Papers which test on the knowledge that is essential for practice as a real estate salesperson.

The RES Examination Syllabus is prepared in the context of local laws, rules and regulations governing estate agency work and practices, and the buying/selling/leasing of HDB flats and private residential, commercial and industrial properties in Singapore.
